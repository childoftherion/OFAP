- New business applications
- License renewals
- Changes to licenses

### Penalties and Fines
- Regulatory enforcement
- Violation penalties
- Relatively small revenue source

- Other fees: ~$5-10 million annually (estimated)
- **Total Additional**: ~$25-40 million annually

## Total Cannabis-Related Revenue

- **Tax Revenue (distributed)**: ~$169.5 million annually (2025-2027)
- **Licensing and Fees**: ~$25-40 million annually
- **Total Cannabis Revenue**: ~$195-210 million annually

## Revenue Trends and Projections

### Market Growth
- **Early Years (2015-2020)**: Rapid growth

## OFAP Funding Potential from Cannabis Tax

### Current Constraints
- **Distribution is Statutorily Mandated**: Cannot easily change allocation
- **Education Gets 40%**: Largest allocation, politically protected
- **Other Programs Depend on Revenue**: Mental health, police, local governments
- **Limited Flexibility**: Most revenue already committed

### Potential Options

#### Option 1: Reallocate from Existing Allocations
**Feasibility**: LOW
- Would require reducing education, mental health, or police funding
- Politically very difficult
- Not recommended

#### Option 2: Increase Tax Rate
**Current Rate**: 17%
**Potential Increase**: 18-20%
**Additional Revenue**: ~$10-20 million annually per 1% increase
**Feasibility**: LOW-MODERATE
**Political Difficulty**: HIGH - industry opposition, consumer price concerns

#### Option 3: Allocate Portion of New/Growing Revenue
**Approach**: Allocate percentage of revenue growth to OFAP
**Amount**: Could allocate 5-10% of new revenue (~$8-17 million annually)
**Feasibility**: MODERATE
**Challenge**: Would still require legislative approval

#### Option 4: Allocate Small Percentage of Total Revenue
**Approach**: Change distribution formula to allocate 2-5% to OFAP
**Amount**: ~$3.4-8.5 million annually (2-5% of $169.5M)
**Feasibility**: MODERATE
**Challenge**: Would require reducing other allocations proportionally

#### Option 5: Dedicate Portion of Mental Health Allocation
**Approach**: Allocate portion of 20% mental health allocation to OFAP
**Rationale**: Food security connects to mental health outcomes
**Amount**: Could allocate 25-50% of mental health portion (~$8-17 million annually)
**Feasibility**: MODERATE
**Challenge**: Mental health advocates may oppose

### Recommended Approach
- **Use as small supplemental source**
- Allocate 5-7% of cannabis tax revenue (~$8-12 million annually)
- Requires legislative or ballot measure approval
- Frame as "expanding benefits of cannabis revenue to food security"
- Maintains primary reliance on General Fund

## Comparison to OFAP Need

### OFAP Annual Cost
- **Low Estimate**: $650 million
- **High Estimate**: $850 million

### Cannabis Tax Capacity
- **Total Tax Revenue**: ~$169.5 million annually
- **Potential Allocation**: ~$8-12 million (5-7%)
- **As Percentage of OFAP Need**: 1.2-1.8% of low estimate

### Conclusion
- **Cannabis tax revenue insufficient alone** to fund OFAP
- **Useful as very small supplemental source** (~$8-12 million annually)
- Should be **minimal part of combination approach**

## Policy Context

### Legal Framework
- Distribution formula set by statute
- Changes require legislative approval
- Ballot measure could also change allocation

### Industry Position
- Industry generally opposes tax increases
- Price competition is concern
- Support for program funding depends on messaging

### Public Health Connection
- Some connection between cannabis tax and health programs
- Mental health allocation creates logical connection
- Food security could be framed as health issue

## Revenue Collection Details

### Collection Process
1. Retailers collect 17% tax at point of sale
2. Tax remitted to OLCC monthly
3. OLCC distributes according to statutory formula
4. Quarterly or annual distribution to recipients

### Compliance
- OLCC enforces tax collection
- Regular audits
- Penalties for non-compliance
- Technology systems track sales

## Data Sources

- OLCC Budget Documents
- Cannabis Tax Distribution Reports
- Oregon Legislative Fiscal Office
- Oregon Office of Economic Analysis
- Industry sales data

## Notes

- All figures are estimates and projections
- Actual revenue varies with market conditions
- Distribution formula is statutory and difficult to change
- Market still maturing - projections may change
- Federal legalization could significantly impact Oregon market
- Revenue growth expected to slow as market stabilizes

## Comparison to Other Revenue Sources

### Cannabis vs. Lottery
- Cannabis: ~$169.5M annually (tax only)
- Lottery: ~$900M annually (gross)
- Lottery much larger revenue source

### Cannabis vs. OLCC Liquor
- Cannabis tax: ~$169.5M annually
- Liquor revenue: ~$352.5M annually
- Liquor revenue significantly larger

### Cannabis vs. General Fund
- Cannabis tax: ~$169.5M annually
- General Fund: $37.3B biennium (~$18.65B annually)
- General Fund vastly larger

### Conclusion
Cannabis tax is a **small but growing revenue source**, useful as a minimal supplemental funding source but insufficient for major program funding.
