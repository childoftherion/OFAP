## Quarterly Distribution Breakdown (Recent Quarters)

### 2024 Q4 Distribution Example

- State School Fund (40%): $30.9M
- Mental Health (20%): $15.4M
- State Police (15%): $11.6M
- Health Authority (5%): $3.9M
- Cities/Counties (20%): $15.4M
- **Total State Tax**: $77.2M

### 2025 Q3 Distribution Example

- State School Fund (40%): $29.4M
- Mental Health (20%): $14.7M
- State Police (15%): $11.0M
- Health Authority (5%): $3.7M
- Cities/Counties (20%): $14.7M
- **Total State Tax**: $73.4M

## Revenue vs. Distributions

**Important Note**: The quarterly distribution amounts represent **state tax distributed**, not total tax collected.

### Collection vs. Distribution

- Retailers retain **2% of taxes collected** for collection costs
- Some taxes collected are **local taxes** (not included in state distributions)
- The "State Tax Total" in distributions represents only the state portion distributed

### Estimated Total Collections

If distributions average $75M per quarter = $300M annually, and this represents ~98% of state tax (after 2% retailer retention):

- **Estimated Annual State Tax Collections**: ~$306M
- This aligns with the ~$312M annual distribution figure

## Implications for Measure 4 (Oregon Cannabis Permanent Fund)

### Current Revenue Reality (2024-2025)

**Actual Annual State Tax Distribution**: ~$310M (based on 2024 actuals)

This is **higher** than the $169.5M projection in current documents, which appears to be outdated.

### Updated Funding Estimates for Measure 4

If Measure 4 allocates:

- **10% of state tax revenue**: ~$31M annually (based on $310M)
- **All licensing fees**: ~$20-30M annually (estimated)
- **Total to Fund**: ~$51-61M annually

### Previous Estimates vs. Actual

| Document Estimate | Actual (2024)   | Difference      |
| ----------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| $169.5M annually  | ~$310M annually | **+83% higher** |

**Critical**: Current proposals significantly underestimate cannabis tax revenue. Actual revenue is nearly double the estimates used.

## Monthly Receipts Analysis

Monthly receipt data shows:

- Data available from February 2016 through present
- Monthly receipts vary significantly (seasonality, market fluctuations)
- Peak months: Typically summer/fall months show higher receipts

## Recommendations

1. **Update Revenue Figures**: Revise all documents to reflect actual ~$310M annual state tax distribution (2024 actuals)

2. **Revise Measure 4 Funding Projections**:

   - 10% allocation = ~$31M annually (not $16.95M)
   - Total fund contributions = ~$51-61M annually (not $37-47M)

3. **Verify Growth Projections**:

   - Current data shows stabilization/decline in 2024-2025
   - May need to adjust 2025-2027 projections downward
   - Market appears to be maturing, not growing rapidly

4. **Update All Budget Documents**:
   - `cannabis-tax-revenue.md` needs complete revision
   - `measure-4-cannabis-permanent-fund.md` needs updated revenue figures
   - `oregon-cannabis-permanent-fund.md` (proposal) needs updates
