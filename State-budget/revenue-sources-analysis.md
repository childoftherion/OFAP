## Revenue Capacity for OFAP

### OFAP Annual Cost Estimate

- **Low Estimate**: $650 million
- **High Estimate**: $850 million

### As Percentage of Key Revenue Sources

- **General Fund (biennium)**: 1.7-2.3%
- **Lottery Fund (biennium)**: 36-47%
- **OLCC Total Revenue (annual)**: 65-85%
- **Cannabis Tax Only (annual)**: 192-251% (insufficient alone)

### Capacity Assessment

- **General Fund**: **SUFFICIENT** - Small percentage, manageable
- **Lottery Fund**: **INSUFFICIENT ALONE** - Would require too large a portion
- **OLCC Revenue**: **INSUFFICIENT ALONE** - Would require majority of revenue
- **Combination**: **VIABLE** - Recommended approach

## Recommended Funding Strategy

### Primary Recommendation: General Fund Primary with Supplemental Sources

1. **Primary Source**: General Fund appropriation ($500-700 million annually)

   - Represents 1.3-1.9% of biennial General Fund
   - Manageable within existing budget structure

2. **Supplemental Sources** (if needed):

   - Small percentage of Lottery Fund (if approved)
   - Small percentage of OLCC/cannabis revenue (if approved)
   - Efficiency savings from other programs

3. **Reserve Use** (if needed):
   - Rainy Day Fund for start-up costs
   - Education Stability Fund (not recommended - wrong purpose)

### Rationale

- General Fund has sufficient capacity
- No new taxes required
- Flexible and sustainable
- Follows successful program funding patterns
- Allows for supplemental sources if needed
