## OFAP Funding Potential from Lottery

### Current Allocation

**Approach**: Allocate 2-5% of lottery net revenue to OFAP

- **Amount**: ~$9-22.5 million annually (from $900M annual)
- **Feasibility**: MODERATE
- **Challenge**: Would require reducing other allocations or legislative approval
- **Political Difficulty**: Moderate - competing with education funding

#### Option 2: New Revenue Allocation

**Approach**: Allocate portion of growth revenue

- **Amount**: Portion of new revenue from growth
- **Feasibility**: MODERATE

- **Amount**: Could be significant (10-20% of net revenue)
- **Feasibility**: LOW
- **Challenge**: Would require reducing education or other popular programs
- **Political Difficulty**: HIGH

#### Option 4: Ballot Measure Allocation

**Approach**: Ballot measure allocates lottery funds to OFAP

### Recommended Approach

- **Use as supplemental funding source**

- Frame as "expanding lottery benefits to food security"
- Maintains primary reliance on General Fund

- **Potential Allocation**: $13-22 million (3-5% of net)
- **As Percentage of OFAP Need**: 2-3.4% of low estimate

### Conclusion

- **Lottery revenue insufficient alone** to fund OFAP
- **Useful as supplemental source** (~$15-20 million annually)
- Should be **part of combination approach**
