- **Mechanism**: Biennial appropriation in state budget
- **Rationale**: Represents manageable percentage, no tax increase needed

**FEASIBILITY: VERY HIGH - RECOMMENDED AS PRIMARY SOURCE**

### 2. Lottery Fund - Supplemental Source

#### Revenue Analysis

- **Biennium Revenue**: $1.8 billion (2025-2027)
- **Gross Annual**: ~$900 million
- **Net to State**: ~$225-270 million annually (25-30% after prizes/operations)
- **Current Distribution**:
  - Education (primary - largest portion)
  - Economic development
  - State parks
  - Natural resources

#### Capacity Assessment

- **Net Revenue Available**: ~$450-540 million biennium
- **OFAP Need**: $1.28-1.71 billion biennium
- **Assessment**: Insufficient alone (would require 240-377% of net)

#### Potential Allocation Options

**Option A: Small Percentage of Net Revenue**

- **Amount**: 3-5% of net lottery revenue
- **Annual**: ~$7-13 million ($14-26M biennium)
- **Feasibility**: MODERATE (requires ballot measure or legislative approval)
- **Political Challenge**: Competes with education funding

**Option B: New Revenue Growth Allocation**

- **Amount**: Portion of lottery revenue growth
- **Feasibility**: MODERATE
- **Advantage**: Doesn't reduce existing allocations

**Option C: Broader Allocation**

- **Amount**: 10-15% of net revenue
- **Annual**: ~$22-40 million
- **Feasibility**: LOW (would require significant reduction in education allocation)

#### Recommended Approach

- **Small Supplemental Allocation**: 3-5% (~$7-13M annually)
- **Mechanism**: Ballot measure or legislative approval
- **Rationale**: Provides cushion, maintains primary reliance on General Fund

**FEASIBILITY: MODERATE - RECOMMENDED AS SMALL SUPPLEMENTAL SOURCE**

### 3. OLCC Revenue - Supplemental Source

- **OFAP Need**: $650-850 million annually
- **Assessment**: Insufficient alone (would require 125-163% of OLCC revenue)

#### Potential Allocation Strategies

**Strategy A: Cannabis Tax Allocation (Small Percentage)**

- **Approach**: Allocate 5-7% of cannabis tax revenue
- **Amount**: ~$8-12 million annually
- **Source**: Would need to reduce other allocations proportionally OR allocate from growth
- **Feasibility**: MODERATE (requires legislative approval)
- **Challenge**: Statutory distribution requirements

**Strategy B: Liquor Revenue Allocation**

- **Approach**: Allocate 5-10% of liquor profits
- **Amount**: ~$18-35 million annually
- **Feasibility**: MODERATE-HIGH (more flexible than cannabis)
- **Advantage**: Less statutorily prescribed

**Strategy C: Mental Health Allocation Connection**

- **Approach**: Allocate portion of mental health funding (20% of cannabis)
- **Rationale**: Food insecurity affects mental health
- **Amount**: Could allocate 10-25% of mental health portion (~$3-8M annually)
- **Feasibility**: MODERATE
- **Challenge**: Mental health advocates may oppose

#### Recommended Approach

- **Cannabis Tax**: Allocate 5-7% (~$8-12M annually)
- **Liquor Revenue**: Allocate 5-7% (~$18-25M annually)
- **Combined**: ~$26-37 million annually supplemental
- **Rationale**: Logical connection to health/social services, growing revenue

**FEASIBILITY: MODERATE - RECOMMENDED AS SUPPLEMENTAL SOURCE**

### 4. Tobacco Tax Revenue - Potential Supplemental Source

#### Current Tobacco Tax Structure

- **Cigarette Tax**: $3.33 per pack (as of 2023)
- **Revenue**: Supports various health programs
- **Annual Revenue**: Not separately tracked in all reports (estimated $100-200M range)

#### Potential for OFAP

- **Rationale**: Tobacco use correlates with food insecurity
- **Approach**: Allocate small percentage of tobacco tax revenue
- **Amount**: ~$5-15 million annually (if approved)
- **Feasibility**: MODERATE
- **Challenge**: Tobacco tax revenue already allocated to health programs

#### Recommendation

- **Potential Supplemental Source**: Small allocation (~$5-10M annually)
- **Not Essential**: Revenue relatively small compared to need

**FEASIBILITY: LOW-MODERATE - OPTIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL**

### 5. Federal Matching Funds - Maximization Strategy

#### Federal Funds Context

- **Total Federal Funds**: $37.9 billion (2025-2027)
- **Major Programs**: Medicaid, SNAP, education grants, infrastructure
- **Current Situation**: SNAP disrupted, creating need for state program

#### Strategy: Maximize Federal Matching When Available

- **Approach**: State program designed to coordinate with federal SNAP
- **Benefit**: When federal funds available, can reduce state share
- **Potential Savings**: $100-200 million annually (when federal SNAP operational)
- **Flexibility**: State program continues even if federal funds unavailable

#### Recommendation

- **Design for Coordination**: OFAP should leverage federal funds when available
- **Maintain Independence**: Don't rely on federal funds for operations
- **Maximize Matching**: Pursue all available federal nutrition program funds

**FEASIBILITY: HIGH - COORDINATION STRATEGY**

### 6. Efficiency Savings and Reallocation Opportunities

#### Program Efficiency

- **Administrative Cost Cap**: 5% (lower than many programs)
- **Leverage Existing Infrastructure**: Use current SNAP/EBT systems
- **Technology Efficiency**: Modern EBT systems reduce administrative burden
- **Fraud Prevention**: Technology-based systems reduce waste

#### Potential Efficiency Sources

- **Improved Program Efficiency**: Savings from streamlined operations
- **Fraud Recovery**: Recovered overpayments returned to fund
- **System Efficiency**: Lower costs as program scales
- **Coordination Savings**: Reduced duplication with other programs

#### Estimated Efficiency Benefits

- **Administrative Savings**: 1-2% of program costs through efficiency
- **Fraud Recovery**: $5-10 million annually (estimated)
- **Total Potential**: ~$10-20 million annually

**FEASIBILITY: HIGH - BUILT INTO PROGRAM DESIGN**

### 7. Reserve Funds - Start-up Only

#### Available Reserves (2025-2027)

- **Education Stability Fund**: $1.26 billion
- **Rainy Day Fund**: $2.16 billion
- **Total Reserves**: $3.42 billion
- **Projected Growth**: $3.78 billion by end of biennium

#### Potential Use

- **Start-up Costs**: One-time infrastructure and system development
- **Amount**: $50-100 million (one-time)
- **Rationale**: Program establishment costs before regular funding begins
- **Note**: NOT for ongoing operations

#### Recommendation

- **Use for Start-up Only**: $50-100 million one-time
- **Maintain Reserves**: Don't deplete reserves for operations
- **Rationale**: Reserves are for emergencies, start-up is one-time need

**FEASIBILITY: HIGH - FOR START-UP COSTS ONLY**

### 8. Corporate Tax Considerations - NOT RECOMMENDED

#### Analysis

- **Corporate Income Tax**: Part of General Fund
- **Corporate Kicker**: $993.1M allocated to education (2023-2025)
- **Measure 118 Failure**: Voters rejected corporate tax increase (2022)

#### Why Not Recommended

- ❌ **Measure 118 Precedent**: Voters rejected corporate tax increases
- ❌ **Political Difficulty**: High opposition from business community
- ❌ **Unnecessary**: General Fund sufficient without new taxes
- ❌ **Ballot Measure History**: Tax increases face strong opposition

#### Recommendation

- **Avoid Corporate Tax Increases**: Learn from Measure 118 failure
- **Use Existing General Fund**: Includes corporate tax revenue already
- **No New Taxes**: Key to broad support

**FEASIBILITY: VERY LOW - NOT RECOMMENDED**

### 9. Other Revenue Sources - Analysis

#### Tourism/Hospitality Surcharge

- **Potential**: Small surcharge on hotel/lodging (0.5-1%)
- **Revenue**: ~$15-30 million annually (estimated)
- **Feasibility**: LOW-MODERATE
- **Challenge**: Tourism industry opposition, minimal revenue

#### Gas Tax (Not Applicable)

- **Dedicated to Transportation**: Cannot be used for other purposes
- **Not Relevant**: For OFAP funding

#### Property Tax (Not Applicable)

- **Local Control**: Maintained at local level
- **Not State Revenue**: Would require constitutional changes
- **Not Recommended**: Maintains local control

#### Sales Tax (Not Applicable)

- **Oregon Has No Sales Tax**: Would require major constitutional change
- **Not Feasible**: Politically impossible
