## OFAP Funding Potential from Alcohol Taxes

### Beer and Wine Tax Options

**Additional Revenue**: ~$5-15 million annually (depending on consumption)
**Feasibility**: LOW-MODERATE
**Political Difficulty**: Moderate - beer industry opposition

**Current Rate**: $0.65 per gallon
**Potential Increase**: Could increase to $1.00-1.50 per gallon
**Additional Revenue**: ~$3-10 million annually (depending on consumption)
**Feasibility**: LOW-MODERATE
**Political Difficulty**: Moderate - wine industry opposition

#### Option 3: New Tax on Alcohol

**Approach**: Add percentage-based tax on all alcohol sales
**Potential Revenue**: $20-50 million annually (estimated)
**Feasibility**: LOW
**Political Difficulty**: HIGH - industry and consumer opposition

### Liquor Revenue Options

_See `olcc-revenue-detailed.md` for detailed analysis_

- Liquor revenue already allocated
- Reallocation would require reducing other programs
- Small allocation possible (~$18-35 million annually)

### Recommended Approach

- **Not recommended as primary source**
- Beer/wine taxes too small
- Liquor revenue already allocated
- Better to use General Fund

## Alcohol Tax Policy Context

- **Wine**: Moderate rate
- **Liquor**: State monopoly provides revenue (not traditional tax)

### Industry Concerns

- Tourism considerations (wine country)
- Economic impact on local businesses
- Consumer price sensitivity

### Public Health Connection

- Some advocate for higher alcohol taxes for public health
- Connection to health costs
- Potential public health justification for tax increases

## Comparison to OFAP Need

### OFAP Annual Cost

- **Low Estimate**: $650 million
- **High Estimate**: $850 million

### Alcohol Tax Capacity

- **Liquor Revenue Allocation**: ~$18-35 million annually (if reallocated)
- **Total Potential**: ~$26-60 million annually
- **As Percentage of OFAP Need**: 4-9% of low estimate

### Conclusion

- **Alcohol tax revenue insufficient alone** to fund OFAP
- **Useful as small supplemental source** (~$20-40 million annually)
- **Not recommended as primary funding mechanism**
