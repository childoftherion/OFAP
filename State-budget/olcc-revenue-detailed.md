## OFAP Funding Potential from OLCC

### Current Allocation Constraints

- **Cannabis Revenue**: Heavily prescribed (schools, mental health, police, local governments)
- **Liquor Revenue**: More flexible, but supports various programs
- **Availability**: Limited unallocated revenue

### Potential Options

#### Option 1: Reallocation from Existing Programs

**Feasibility**: LOW

- Would require reducing other program funding
- Political difficulty of reducing education, mental health, or police funding
- Not recommended

#### Option 2: New Allocation from Cannabis Revenue

**Feasibility**: MODERATE

- Would require legislative or ballot measure approval
- Could allocate portion of new/growing revenue
- Connection to health and social services makes logical sense
- **Potential Amount**: Could allocate 5-10% of cannabis tax revenue (~$17-34 million annually)

#### Option 3: New Allocation from Liquor Revenue

**Feasibility**: MODERATE-HIGH

- More flexibility than cannabis revenue
- Could allocate small percentage of liquor profits
- Less politically sensitive than reducing other allocations
- **Potential Amount**: Could allocate 5-10% of liquor profits (~$18-35 million annually)

#### Option 4: Increase Cannabis Tax Rate

**Feasibility**: LOW-MODERATE

- Would require legislative or ballot measure
- Current rate: 17%
- Could increase to 20-22%
- Would face industry opposition
- **Potential Additional Revenue**: ~$6-10 million annually per 1% increase

### Recommended Approach

- **Supplemental funding source only**
- Allocate 5-7% of cannabis tax revenue to OFAP
- Would generate ~$17-24 million annually
- Represents small portion of total OLCC revenue
- Maintains primary reliance on General Fund

## Comparison to OFAP Need

### OFAP Annual Cost

- **Low Estimate**: $650 million
- **High Estimate**: $850 million

### OLCC Revenue Capacity

- **Available for Reallocation**: ~$35-60 million annually (estimated)
- **As Percentage of OFAP Need**: 5-9% of low estimate

### Conclusion

- **OLCC revenue insufficient alone** to fund OFAP
- **Useful as supplemental source** (~$20-40 million annually)
- Should be **part of combination approach** with General Fund primary
