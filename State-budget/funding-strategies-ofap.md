- **Annual Allocation**: $650-850 million from ~$18.65 billion annual

#### Advantages
- ✅ Largest revenue source
- ✅ Most flexible funding mechanism
- ✅ No new taxes required
- ✅ Established appropriation process
- ✅ Can adjust based on economic conditions

#### Disadvantages
- ⚠️ Competes with other General Fund priorities
- ⚠️ Subject to economic cycles
- ⚠️ Requires legislative priority

#### Feasibility: **VERY HIGH**
**Recommendation**: **PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE**

### 2. Lottery Fund

#### Capacity Assessment
- **Biennial Revenue**: $1.8 billion
- **Net to State**: ~$450-540 million (biennium) - 25-30% of gross
- **OFAP Need**: $1.3-1.7 billion (biennium)
- **Percentage**: OFAP would require 240-377% of lottery net revenue

#### Advantages
- ✅ Dedicated fund structure
- ✅ Relatively stable revenue
- ✅ Public acceptance of lottery

#### Disadvantages
- ❌ **Insufficient alone** - would require entire lottery net revenue plus more
- ⚠️ Currently allocated to education (primary)
- ⚠️ Would compete with popular programs

#### Potential Supplemental Allocation
- **Amount**: 3-5% of net lottery revenue
- **Annual**: ~$7-13 million
- **Feasibility**: MODERATE (requires approval)

**Recommendation**: **SUPPLEMENTAL SOURCE ONLY** (small amount)

### 3. OLCC Revenue

#### Liquor Revenue
- **Annual**: ~$352.5 million
- **OFAP Need**: $650-850 million annually
- **Assessment**: Insufficient alone (would require 184-241% of liquor revenue)

#### Cannabis Tax Revenue
- **Annual**: ~$169.5 million
- **Distribution**: Heavily prescribed (40% to schools, 20% mental health, etc.)
- **Assessment**: Very limited flexibility

#### Combined OLCC Potential
- **Available for Reallocation**: ~$35-60 million annually (estimated)
- **As Percentage of OFAP**: 5-9%

#### Advantages
- ✅ Growing revenue source (especially cannabis)
- ✅ Some logical connection to health/social services
- ✅ Relatively stable

#### Disadvantages
- ❌ **Insufficient alone**
- ⚠️ Cannabis revenue heavily prescribed by statute
- ⚠️ Liquor revenue already allocated

- **Assessment**: Small portion of need

#### Advantages
- ✅ Public health connection (alcohol and food insecurity)

#### Disadvantages
- ❌ Very small revenue potential
- ⚠️ Industry opposition
- ⚠️ Consumer price sensitivity

**Recommendation**: **NOT RECOMMENDED** - Too small, political difficulty

### 5. Cannabis Tax Increases
