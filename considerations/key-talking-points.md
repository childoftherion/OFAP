# Key Talking Points: Oregon Food Security Ballot Measures

## 30-Second Elevator Pitch

"757,000 Oregonians just lost their food benefits due to federal shutdown. We need a state-funded program to protect Oregon families. This creates a food assistance program using existing state funds - no new taxes required - that ensures no Oregonian goes hungry, regardless of what happens in Washington DC."

## The Problem (Crisis Facts)

- **757,000 Oregonians** lost SNAP benefits due to federal government shutdown
- Governor declared **60-day food security emergency**
- State allocated $5 million emergency funds to food banks
- Federal programs can be disrupted - Oregon needs independence
- Food insecurity affects **1 in 5 Oregonians** even in good times

## The Solution (What We're Proposing)

### Three Complementary Ballot Measures:

1. **Constitutional Amendment**: Makes food security a fundamental right (like healthcare)
2. **Program Act**: Creates the actual EBT food assistance program
3. **Funding Fund**: Establishes dedicated fund with oversight

### Key Features:

- State-funded, independent of federal government
- Monthly EBT benefits (like SNAP, but state-funded)
- Eligibility: Households at 185% of poverty level
- All Oregon residents eligible (working families, seniors, children)
- Uses existing General Fund - **no new taxes required**
- Efficient administration (5% cost cap)
- Independent oversight board

## Why This Will Pass (Support Strategy)
