## Potential Issues and Recommendations

### ✅ No Unfunded Mandates

**Finding**: All measures are administered by state agencies with state funding. No local government mandates are created.

**Action**: None required

### ✅ Funding Provisions Are Constitutional

**Finding**: All funding mechanisms are constitutional and maintain Legislature's appropriations authority.

**Action**: None required

### ⚠️ Minor Language Clarification (Recommended but Not Required)

**Measure 1 - Subsection (4)**: Consider adding clarification that funding is subject to Legislature's appropriations authority and available revenues.

**Current Language**:

> "The State Legislature shall appropriate sufficient funds to operate the food assistance program."

**Recommendation** (Optional):

> "The State Legislature shall appropriate sufficient funds to operate the food assistance program, subject to available state revenues and the Legislature's appropriations authority under the Oregon Constitution."

**Rationale**: Makes explicit that Legislature's appropriations authority is maintained, addressing potential concerns about constitutional separation of powers.

**Status**: Current language is legally sufficient; this is an optional enhancement for clarity.

## Comparison to Successful Oregon Measures

### Measure 111 (2022) - Healthcare Right

✅ **Measure 1 follows similar structure**:

- Establishes fundamental right
- Requires state program
- Legislature controls funding
- ✅ **Measure 111 was upheld** - Good precedent

### Oregon Common School Fund (1859)

✅ **Measure 4 follows similar structure**:

- Constitutional permanent fund
- Dedicated revenue source
- Principal protection
- ✅ **165+ years of successful operation** - Strong precedent

## Legal Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Areas ✅

1. **Unfunded Mandate Claims**: Very low risk - No local government mandates
2. **Constitutional Challenges**: Low risk - Follows established precedents (Measure 111, Common School Fund)
3. **Separation of Powers**: Low risk - Legislature maintains appropriations authority
4. **Single Subject**: Low risk - Each measure addresses single, coherent subject

### Moderate Risk Areas ⚠️

1. **Funding Level Challenges**: Moderate risk - Opponents may argue "sufficient funds" is vague

   - **Mitigation**: Similar language used in Measure 111, which was upheld
   - Legislature determines "sufficient" based on available revenues

2. **Constitutional Interpretation**: Moderate risk - Courts may interpret "sufficient funds" differently
   - **Mitigation**: Language gives Legislature flexibility, similar to Measure 111

### High Risk Areas

**None identified** - All measures follow established legal precedents

---

## Recommendations for Final Draft

### Required Changes: None ✅

All measures are compliant as drafted.

### Optional Enhancements (Recommended for Clarity):

1. **Measure 1**: Consider adding language explicitly stating Legislature's appropriations authority (see Minor Language Clarification above)

2. **All Measures**: Consider adding implementation timelines that acknowledge potential budget constraints

   - Example: "Implementation shall occur within available appropriations"

3. **Measure 3**: Consider clarifying that General Fund appropriations are subject to biennial budget process
   - Current language already implies this, but explicit statement may reduce opposition

### Legal Review Recommendations

1. **Pre-Filing Review**: Have all measures reviewed by Oregon Attorney General or qualified election law attorney
2. **Ballot Title Review**: Ensure ballot titles comply with ORS 250.035 (15-word caption, 20-word question, 175-word summary)
3. **Constitutional Analysis**: Obtain formal constitutional analysis from Legislative Counsel or Attorney General

---

## Conclusion

✅ **All measures are legally compliant** with:

- Oregon's Unfunded Mandate Law
- Oregon Constitution requirements
- Single Subject Rule
- Appropriation provisions

**No changes required** for legal compliance. Optional language clarifications may enhance political viability and reduce opposition arguments, but current language is legally sufficient.

**Next Steps**:

1. Optional: Add language clarifications for enhanced clarity
2. Required: Obtain formal legal review from Oregon Attorney General or qualified election law attorney before filing
3. Recommended: Pre-file with Secretary of State for ballot title review
