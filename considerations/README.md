# Oregon Food Security Ballot Measures: Considerations and Proposals

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive proposals for establishing a state-funded EBT-style food assistance program in Oregon. These proposals are designed to address the current food crisis affecting 757,000 Oregonians who have lost federal SNAP benefits due to government shutdown.

## Current Crisis

- **757,000 Oregonians** depend on SNAP benefits that have been disrupted
- Governor Tina Kotek has declared a **60-day food security emergency**
- State allocated $5 million to food banks as emergency response
- **Critical need**: Establish state-funded program independent of federal funding

## Proposed Ballot Measures

**Note**: These measures can be proposed together or independently. Measure 4 (Cannabis Permanent Fund) is independent but complementary to Measures 1-3.

### Measure 1: Oregon Food Security Amendment (Constitutional)

**File**: `measure-1-constitutional-amendment.md`

Establishes food security as a fundamental right in the Oregon Constitution, similar to Measure 111 (healthcare). Creates legal framework requiring state to maintain food assistance program.

**Key Features:**

- Constitutional amendment for permanence
- Frames food security as fundamental right
- Requires state program independent of federal funding
- Provides framework for implementation

### Measure 2: Oregon Food Assistance Program Act (Statutory)

**File**: `measure-2-statutory-program-act.md`

Creates the actual program - eligibility, benefits, administration, OFAP card system. Detailed implementation framework.

**Key Features:**

- Eligibility: Universal for all United States citizens who are natural persons and full-time Oregon residents
- Benefits: Monthly OFAP card benefits based on household size (using federal Thrifty Food Plan standards, no income-based reductions)
- Purchase Restrictions: OFAP cards can only be used for authorized food items - staples, raw ingredients, seeds, and food-bearing plants
- Administration: Oregon Department of Human Services
- All residents eligible (no immigration status restrictions)

### Measure 3: Oregon Food Security Fund (Statutory)

**File**: `measure-3-funding-mechanism.md`

Establishes dedicated funding source with oversight board. Ensures transparency and fiscal responsibility.

**Key Features:**

- Dedicated fund separate from General Fund
- Primary funding from existing General Fund (no new taxes required)
- Independent oversight board
- Multiple revenue sources (flexibility)
- Administrative cost cap: 5%

### Measure 4: Oregon Cannabis Permanent Fund (Constitutional)

**File**: `measure-4-cannabis-permanent-fund.md`

Creates a constitutionally protected permanent fund from existing cannabis tax revenues and fees, similar to Alaska Permanent Fund. Provides long-term financial asset for future generations of Oregonians.

**Key Features:**

- Constitutional amendment for permanence (like Alaska Permanent Fund)
- **NO NEW TAXES**: Uses only existing 17% tax rate and existing fees
- 10% of existing tax revenue + all licensing fees to permanent fund
- Principal protection: Principal cannot be spent without voter approval
- Earnings protection: Earnings cannot be used for education, health, or general fund
- Public vote required for any earnings reallocation changes
- Universal dividends or direct payment programs
- Private cannabis industry continues operating unchanged

**Revenue Source:**

- 10% of existing cannabis tax revenue (~$29-31M annually, based on actual 2024-2025 data)
- All existing licensing fees ($20-30M annually)
- Total: ~$49-61 million annually (100% from existing revenues)
- **⚠️ Updated**: Revenue figures reflect official DOR data showing ~$290-310M annual tax distributions (not previous $169.5M estimate)

### Proposal Overview

**File**: `proposal-overview.md`

Strategic overview and rationale for the three-measure approach, lessons learned from past Oregon ballot measures, and key principles for success.

## Design Principles

### 1. Learn from History

- **Measure 111 (2022) - SUCCESS**: Healthcare as fundamental right → Framed as right, not just benefit
- **Measure 118 (2022) - FAILURE**: Corporate tax increases → Avoid punitive taxation

### 2. Build Broad Support

- **Progressive Appeal**: Human rights, social justice, universal access
- **Conservative Appeal**: State sovereignty, fiscal responsibility, economic efficiency
- **Business Appeal**: Economic growth, consumer spending, stable markets
- **Rural Appeal**: Agricultural support, local economy, community stability

### 3. Fiscal Responsibility

- Primary funding from existing General Fund
- No new taxes required (supplemental sources optional)
- Administrative cost cap: 5%
- Independent oversight and transparency
- Efficiency and cost controls built in

### 4. Practical Implementation

- Leverage existing SNAP infrastructure
- Phased rollout (pilot → full implementation)
- Proven EBT technology
- Coordination with federal programs (when available)

## Estimated Costs and Benefits

### Annual Program Costs

- Benefits: $600-800 million
- Administration: $30-40 million (5% cap)
- Systems: $10-15 million
- **Total: $640-855 million annually**

### Economic Benefits

**Economic Multiplier Effect:**

- Every $1 in food assistance generates $1.50-$2.00 in economic activity
- Economic activity generated: $960 million - $1.7 billion annually
- Tax revenue generated: $50-100 million annually

**Cost Savings:**

- Healthcare cost savings: $100-200 million annually
  - Reduced ER visits, chronic disease management, mental health improvements
  - Research shows: $1 in food assistance saves $2-3 in healthcare costs
- Workforce productivity: $20-40 million annually
- Social services savings: $15-30 million annually
- Agricultural sector support: $75-150 million annually

**Net Economic Benefit:**

- Program cost: $750 million annually (mid-range)
- Total economic benefits: $1.22 billion - $2.22 billion annually
- Net benefit: $470 million - $1.47 billion annually
- **Return on investment: 163-296% annually**

### Funding Sources (Based on NASBO Oregon Budget Data - FY2026-2027)

**Primary Sources:**

- State General Fund: $650-750 million annually ($1.3-1.5 billion biennium)
  - Represents 3.5-4.0% of biennial General Fund ($37.3 billion)
  - Uses existing revenue, no new taxes required
- Efficiency savings (built-in): $15-30 million annually

**Note on Federal Funds:**
Federal SNAP benefits ($100-200 million annually when operational) are distributed directly to eligible individuals through federal programs and are NOT deposited into the Oregon Food Security Fund. The state fund operates independently, providing state-funded benefits. When federal SNAP is available, households may receive both federal and state benefits through separate distribution systems.

**Supplemental Sources:**

- OLCC Revenue: $32-47 million annually (cannabis + liquor)
  - Cannabis tax: ~$14.5-21.7M (5-7% of ~$290-310M actual revenue)
  - Liquor revenue: $18-25M (5-7% of ~$352.5M)
  - Cannabis tax data: [Oregon Department of Revenue - Marijuana Tax Statistics](https://www.oregon.gov/dor/gov-research/pages/default.aspx)
  - **⚠️ Updated**: Based on official DOR data showing actual cannabis tax ~$290-310M annually (2024-2025), not previous $169.5M estimate
- Lottery Fund: $7-13 million annually
- Transient Lodging Tax: $15-30 million annually (optional)
  - Data: [Oregon Department of Revenue - Lodging Tax Report](https://www.oregon.gov/dor/gov-research/pages/default.aspx)
- Tobacco Tax: $5-15 million annually (optional)

**Budget Context:**

- Total State Budget (2025-2027 biennium): $138.9 billion (NASBO data)
- General Fund (2025-2027 biennium): $37.3 billion (NASBO data)
- OFAP represents only 0.93-1.08% of total state budget
- Highly manageable investment with positive economic returns

---

**Note**: These proposals are designed to have broad public support in Oregon. They incorporate lessons from successful ballot measures (Measure 111) and avoid pitfalls of failed measures (Measure 118).

**Measure Relationships:**

- **Measures 1-3**: Work together to establish Oregon Food Assistance Program (OFAP)

  - Measure 1: Constitutional framework
  - Measure 2: Program implementation
  - Measure 3: Funding mechanism (General Fund based)

- **Measure 4**: Independent permanent fund from cannabis revenues
  - Creates separate permanent endowment fund
  - Can complement Measures 1-3 but operates independently
  - Provides long-term financial asset for all Oregonians

**Flexibility**: All four measures can be passed together for maximum impact, or individual measures can stand alone if needed. Measure 4 is designed to work independently but could eventually provide earnings that supplement other programs (subject to voter approval for any earnings reallocation).
