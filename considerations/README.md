# Oregon Food Security Ballot Measures: Considerations and Proposals

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive proposals for establishing a state-funded EBT-style food assistance program in Oregon. These proposals are designed to address the current food crisis affecting 757,000 Oregonians who have lost federal SNAP benefits due to government shutdown.

## Current Crisis

- **757,000 Oregonians** depend on SNAP benefits that have been disrupted
- Governor Tina Kotek has declared a **60-day food security emergency**
- State allocated $5 million to food banks as emergency response
- **Critical need**: Establish state-funded program independent of federal funding

## Proposed Ballot Measures

### Measure 1: Oregon Food Security Amendment (Constitutional)

**File**: `measure-1-constitutional-amendment.md`

Establishes food security as a fundamental right in the Oregon Constitution, similar to Measure 111 (healthcare). Creates legal framework requiring state to maintain food assistance program.

**Key Features:**

- Administration: Oregon Department of Human Services
- All residents eligible (no immigration status restrictions)

### Measure 3: Oregon Food Security Fund (Statutory)

**File**: `measure-3-funding-mechanism.md`

Establishes dedicated funding source with oversight board. Ensures transparency and fiscal responsibility.

## Design Principles

### 1. Learn from History

- **Rural Appeal**: Agricultural support, local economy, community stability

### 3. Fiscal Responsibility

- Primary funding from existing General Fund
- No new taxes required (supplemental sources optional)
- Administrative cost cap: 5%
- Independent oversight and transparency
- Efficiency and cost controls built in

### 4. Practical Implementation

- Leverage existing SNAP infrastructure
- Phased rollout (pilot → full implementation)
- Proven EBT technology
- Coordination with federal programs (when available)

## Estimated Costs and Benefits

### Annual Program Costs

- Benefits: $600-800 million
- Administration: $30-40 million (5% cap)

**Note**: These proposals are designed to have broad public support in Oregon. They incorporate lessons from successful ballot measures (Measure 111) and avoid pitfalls of failed measures (Measure 118). The three-measure approach provides flexibility - all three can be passed together for maximum impact, or individual measures can stand alone if needed.
