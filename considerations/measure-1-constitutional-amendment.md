## Full Text (Proposed)

### Section 47 - Food Security Right

**Subsection (1) - Right Established**
It is the obligation of the State of Oregon to ensure that every resident has access to adequate and nutritious food. Access to food security is recognized as a fundamental right, essential for health, dignity, and participation in society.

**Subsection (2) - State Program Required**
The State shall establish and maintain a food assistance program that:
(a) Provides monthly food assistance benefits to eligible Oregon residents
(b) Operates independently of federal funding to ensure continuity of benefits
(c) Utilizes OFAP cards (restricted payment cards) that can only be used to purchase authorized food items for home consumption, including but not limited to, staples, raw ingredients, seeds, food-bearing plants, and any other products designated by the administration agency
(d) Is administered by the Oregon Department of Human Services or designated state agency

**Subsection (3) - Eligibility Criteria**
Eligibility for food assistance shall be universal for all Oregon residents who meet the following requirements:
(a) Be a citizen of the United States,
(b) Be a natural person (not a corporation or other legal artificial person),
(c) Be a full-time resident of the State of Oregon, and
(d) Meet residency verification requirements as established by law

Non-Discrimination Policy
The program shall serve all eligible residents without discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, marital status, familial status, disability, veteran status, income, household size, or employment status.

**Subsection (4) - Funding**
The State Legislature shall appropriate sufficient funds to operate the food assistance program. The program may be funded through:
(a) State General Fund allocations
(b) Dedicated revenue streams established by the Legislature
(c) Other state revenue sources as determined by the Legislature

**Note:** Federal SNAP benefits are distributed directly to eligible individuals through federal programs and are separate from state-funded food assistance. The state program operates independently of federal funding, though households may receive both federal and state benefits when federal SNAP is available.

**Subsection (5) - Implementation Timeline**
The program shall be implemented within 24 months of this amendment's approval. The Legislature may establish a phased implementation schedule.

**Subsection (6) - Oversight and Accountability**
The State shall establish oversight mechanisms to ensure program effectiveness, prevent fraud, and maintain fiscal responsibility.

## Rationale for Constitutional Approach

### Precedent: Measure 111 (Healthcare Right)

- Successfully established healthcare as a fundamental right in 2022
- Provides legal foundation for state action
- Creates long-term commitment beyond individual legislative sessions
- Demonstrates Oregon's values and priorities

### Precedent: Oregon Common School Fund

- **165+ Years of Success**: Oregon has successfully managed a constitutionally protected permanent fund for 165+ years
- **Public Trust**: Oregonians understand and support constitutionally protected permanent funds
- **Proven Model**: Common School Fund demonstrates constitutional protection works in Oregon
- **Management Expertise**: State has proven ability to manage permanent funds professionally
- **See**: [Oregon Common School Fund Documentation](../Examples/oregon-common-school-fund.md)

### Supporting Evidence: State Permanent Funds

Multiple states have successfully established and maintained constitutionally protected permanent funds:

- **Alaska Permanent Fund** (1976-Present, 48+ years): $64-80 billion fund demonstrates constitutional protection provides permanence
- **Texas Permanent School Fund** (1854-Present, 170+ years): Longest-running permanent fund, demonstrates long-term success
- **Texas Permanent University Fund** (1876-Present, 148+ years): $30+ billion fund from dedicated resources
- **North Dakota Legacy Fund** (2010-Present, 14+ years): $9.4+ billion accumulated through automatic funding formula
- **Alabama Trust Fund** (1985-Present, 39+ years): Constitutional protection provides long-term stability
- **Cautionary Example - West Virginia Future Fund** (2014-2023): Statutory-only program closed after 9 years, demonstrating need for constitutional protection

**See**: [Supporting Evidence Summary](../Examples/supporting-evidence-summary.md) for comprehensive analysis of all permanent fund examples.

### Advantages

1. **Permanent Framework**: Constitutional amendments are more durable than statutes - proven by 48-170+ years of successful operation in other states
2. **Legal Foundation**: Provides clear mandate for state action - Oregon Common School Fund demonstrates this works in Oregon
3. **Bipartisan Appeal**: Frames as fundamental right rather than partisan policy
4. **Public Trust**: Shows long-term commitment to food security - Oregonians trust constitutionally protected programs

### Messaging

- "Make food security a fundamental right, like healthcare"
- "Ensure permanent protection from federal funding disruptions"
- "Oregon values: No one should go hungry"

## Arguments for Support

### Moral and Ethical

- Food is a basic human need and human right
- No Oregonian should experience hunger in a state of plenty
- Dignity and respect for all residents

### Economic

- Healthy, well-nourished population is more productive
- Reduces healthcare costs associated with malnutrition
- Stimulates local economy through food purchases

### Practical

- Protects Oregon from federal funding disruptions
- Ensures continuity of benefits during emergencies
- Builds resilience into state social safety net

### Constitutional Structure

- Creates framework, allows Legislature to determine specifics
- Maintains separation of powers
- Provides accountability through oversight requirements

## Potential Opposition and Responses

### "Too Expensive"

**Response**: Food insecurity costs more in healthcare, lost productivity, and social services than prevention. The program will use existing infrastructure and be phased in.

### "Federal Government Already Provides This"

**Response**: Current crisis shows federal programs can be disrupted. This creates a state safety net to protect Oregonians.

### "Constitutional Amendment is Too Permanent"

**Response**: This creates a framework, not a mandate for specific spending. Legislature maintains control over funding levels and program details.

### "Will Increase Taxes"

**Response**: Amendment does not mandate new taxes. Legislature will determine funding sources, which may include reallocation of existing funds, economic growth, and efficiency savings.

## Support Coalition Strategy

### Key Endorsements Needed

- Oregon Food Bank
- Partners for a Hunger-Free Oregon
- Healthcare organizations (Oregon Medical Association, nurses unions)
- Agricultural associations (Oregon Farm Bureau, Oregon Farmers Market Association)
- Faith-based organizations (interfaith hunger coalitions)
- Labor organizations (workers who benefit from food assistance)
- Business associations (Oregon Business Council - economic stability argument)
- Education organizations (school nutrition advocates)

### Rural Strategy

- Emphasize support for Oregon farmers
- Local food purchases keep dollars in Oregon
- Agricultural stability benefits

### Urban Strategy

- Address food deserts
- Support working families
- Improve public health outcomes

## Implementation Considerations

### Constitutional Requirements

- Requires majority vote to pass
- Takes effect upon approval
- Legislature must implement within constitutional framework

### Next Steps After Approval

1. Legislature must pass enabling legislation
2. Department of Human Services develops program details
3. System development and infrastructure setup
4. Phased rollout

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Authority

- States have broad authority to establish social programs
- Similar to Measure 111's healthcare right
- No conflict with federal law (state supplementing, not replacing federal programs)

### Potential Legal Challenges

- Unlikely if properly drafted and implemented
- Federal preemption concerns: Mitigated by creating state program that supplements rather than conflicts with federal SNAP

## Polling and Public Opinion Strategy

### Key Messages to Test

- "Food security is a fundamental right"
- "Protect Oregon families from federal disruptions"
- "No Oregonian should go hungry"
- "Support Oregon farmers and local economy"

### Target Demographics

- All income levels (food insecurity affects working families)
- All regions (rural and urban)
- All political affiliations (moral and economic arguments)
- Families with children (strongest support base)
