## Rationale for Funding Approach

### Strategic Funding Philosophy

**Avoid Tax Increases Where Possible**

- Learning from Measure 118 failure
- Primary reliance on General Fund (existing revenue)
- Supplemental sources are optional, not required
- Emphasis on efficiency and existing resources

**Build Bipartisan Support**

- Fiscal conservatives: Efficiency, oversight, cost controls
- Progressives: Dedicated funding, accountability, transparency
- Business: Stable funding, economic benefits
- Rural: Supports agriculture, local economy

**Flexibility and Sustainability**

- Multiple revenue sources (diversification)
- Economic adjustment mechanisms
- Reserve fund for emergencies
- Long-term sustainability planning

### Why This Approach Works

1. **Primary Funding: General Fund**

   - Uses existing state revenue
   - No new taxes required
   - Legislature maintains control
   - Adjustable based on economic conditions

2. **Oversight and Accountability**

   - Independent board ensures fiscal responsibility
   - Public transparency builds trust
   - Performance metrics demonstrate effectiveness
   - Efficiency requirements control costs

3. **Economic Logic**

   - Food assistance creates economic activity
   - Multiplier effect generates tax revenue
   - Reduces healthcare and social service costs
   - Supports local businesses and farmers

4. **Federal Coordination**
   - Maximizes federal matching when available
   - Provides backup when federal funds unavailable
   - Leverages existing infrastructure
   - No duplication of services

## Arguments for Support

### Fiscal Responsibility

- Dedicated fund ensures transparency
- Independent oversight prevents waste
- Administrative cost controls (5% cap)
- Efficiency measures built in
- Reserve fund for emergencies

### Economic Benefits

- Every $1 in food assistance generates $1.50-$2.00 in economic activity
- Supports local retailers and farmers
- Creates jobs in food distribution
- Reduces healthcare costs
- Improves workforce productivity

- Improves health outcomes
- Supports children's education
- Reduces poverty
- Strengthens communities

### State Sovereignty

## Funding Estimates

### Initial Program Costs (Estimated)

Based on serving 757,000 Oregonians at 185% poverty level:

- **Annual Benefit Costs**: $600-800 million
  - Assumes average benefit of $200-250/month per household
  - Average household size: 2.2 persons
- **Administrative Costs**: $30-40 million (5% of benefits)
- **System Costs**: $10-15 million annually
- **Total Estimated Annual Cost**: $640-855 million

### Funding Sources (Potential)

- **General Fund**: Primary source, $500-700 million annually
- **Federal Matching**: When available, $100-200 million (reduces state need)
- **Supplemental Sources** (if enacted):
  - Corporate tax adjustment: $20-50 million
  - Tourism surcharge: $15-30 million
  - Other sources: $10-25 million

### Economic Return

- **Economic Activity Generated**: $960 million - $1.7 billion annually
- **Tax Revenue Generated**: $50-100 million annually (state and local)
- **Healthcare Cost Savings**: $100-200 million annually
- **Net Economic Benefit**: Positive return on investment

## Support Strategy

### Key Messages

- "Dedicated fund ensures transparency and accountability"
- "Uses existing resources, no new taxes required"
- "Economic benefits exceed costs"
- "Protects Oregon families from federal disruptions"
- "Independent oversight ensures fiscal responsibility"

### Coalition Building

- Fiscal conservatives: Oversight, efficiency, cost controls
- Progressives: Dedicated funding, transparency, accountability
- Business: Economic benefits, stable funding
- Rural: Agricultural support, local economy
- Urban: Food security, economic development

### Modifications for Broader Appeal

If initial polling shows funding concerns:

1. Lower initial funding levels with phased expansion
2. Eliminate optional tax sources from measure text
3. Emphasize General Fund reallocation only
4. Add stronger language prohibiting tax increases
