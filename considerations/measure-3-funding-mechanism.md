# Ballot Measure 3: Oregon Food Security Fund

## Type: Statutory Initiative

## Title

**Oregon Food Security Fund**

## Short Ballot Title

"Creates dedicated fund for food assistance; establishes funding sources and oversight"

## Summary

This measure establishes the Oregon Food Security Fund as a dedicated funding source for the Oregon Food Assistance Program. The fund receives revenue only from state sources including state budget allocations, efficiency savings, and optional revenue enhancements. Federal SNAP benefits are distributed directly to recipients through federal programs and are NOT deposited into this fund. An independent oversight board ensures fiscal responsibility and program effectiveness.

## Full Text (Proposed)

### Section 1 - Fund Establishment

**412.200 - Oregon Food Security Fund Created**
(a) There is established in the State Treasury, separate and distinct from the General Fund, the Oregon Food Security Fund.

(b) The fund shall be continuously appropriated to the Department of Human Services for the purpose of operating the Oregon Food Assistance Program.

(c) Moneys in the fund may not be used for any purpose other than the Oregon Food Assistance Program.

**412.205 - Fund Purpose**
The Oregon Food Security Fund shall be used exclusively for:
(a) Food assistance benefits distributed to eligible households
(b) Administrative costs of program operation (not to exceed 5% of annual disbursements)
(c) EBT system operation and maintenance
(d) Program outreach and education
(e) Fraud prevention and investigation

### Section 2 - Revenue Sources

**412.210 - Primary Funding Sources (Required)**
The Oregon Food Security Fund shall receive moneys from the following sources, listed in order of recommended priority based on fiscal feasibility and bipartisan support:

(a) **State General Fund Appropriations**

- **Amount**: $650-750 million annually ($1.3-1.5 billion biennium)
- **Percentage of General Fund**: 3.5-4.0% of biennial General Fund
- **Feasibility**: VERY HIGH - Uses existing revenue, no new taxes required
- **Political Support**: BROADEST BIPARTISAN SUPPORT
  - Fiscal conservatives: Uses existing funds, no tax increases
  - Progressives: Dedicated funding for essential services
  - Business community: Predictable, state-controlled funding
  - Rural communities: Supports local agriculture and economy
- **Mechanism**: Annual/biennial appropriation by Legislature
- **Flexibility**: May be adjusted based on economic conditions and revenue availability
- **Rationale**: Represents manageable percentage of state budget, leverages existing tax revenue structure

**Note on Federal Funds (Not a Revenue Source for Oregon Food Security Fund):**
Federal funds for food assistance (including SNAP benefits) are distributed directly to eligible individuals through federal programs and are NOT deposited into the Oregon Food Security Fund. Federal benefits are provided separately from state benefits, similar to how federal SNAP currently operates. The Oregon Food Security Fund contains only state revenues for state-funded food assistance.

When federal SNAP is operational, eligible households receive federal benefits directly through the federal program. The Oregon Food Assistance Program provides state-funded benefits from the Oregon Food Security Fund to supplement or replace federal benefits when federal funding is unavailable. This dual-system approach ensures continuity of benefits while maintaining clear separation between federal and state funding streams.

(c) **Efficiency Savings and Revenue Recovery**

- **Amount**: $10-20 million annually from efficiency + $5-10 million from fraud recovery = **$15-30 million total annually**
- **Feasibility**: VERY HIGH - Built into program design, no additional appropriations needed
- **Political Support**: VERY HIGH - Demonstrates fiscal responsibility
- **Sources**:
  - Savings from improved program efficiency (1-2% of program costs)
  - Technology-enabled administrative streamlining
  - Recovered fraud and overpayment funds
  - Interest earned on fund balances
  - Coordination savings from reduced duplication with other programs
- **Transparency**: All savings and recoveries automatically deposited to fund

**412.215 - Supplemental Revenue Sources (Optional - Moderate Bipartisan Support)**

**412.225 - Comprehensive Funding Structure and Projections**

This section provides detailed funding mechanisms, economic impact data, and cost savings projections to demonstrate program sustainability and economic benefits.

(a) **Complete Annual Funding Structure**

The following table outlines specific funding amounts from all sources, prioritized by bipartisan support likelihood:

| Funding Source         | Annual Amount | Biennium Amount | Bipartisan Support | Feasibility   | Status           |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ------------- | ---------------- |
| **General Fund**       | $650-750M     | $1.3-1.5B       | ⭐⭐⭐ HIGHEST     | VERY HIGH     | Required         |
| **Efficiency Savings** | $15-30M       | $30-60M         | ⭐⭐⭐ HIGH        | VERY HIGH     | Built-in         |
| **OLCC Revenue**       | $26-37M       | $52-74M         | ⭐⭐ MODERATE-HIGH | MODERATE-HIGH | Optional         |
| **Lottery Fund**       | $7-13M        | $14-26M         | ⭐⭐ MODERATE      | MODERATE      | Optional         |
| **Lodging Tax**        | $15-30M       | $30-60M         | ⭐⭐ MODERATE      | MODERATE      | Optional         |
| **Tobacco Tax**        | $5-15M        | $10-30M         | ⭐⭐ MODERATE      | MODERATE      | Optional         |
| **TOTAL AVAILABLE**    | **$718-895M** | **$1.44-1.79B** |                    |               | **Exceeds need** |

**Note:** Federal SNAP benefits are distributed directly to recipients through federal programs and are NOT included in this table, as they are not deposited into the Oregon Food Security Fund. When federal SNAP is operational, households receive federal benefits separately from state benefits.

**Minimum Viable Funding** (High bipartisan support only):

- General Fund: $650M annually
- Efficiency Savings: $15M annually
- **Total: $665M annually** - Meets minimum program need ✅

**Recommended Funding** (Primary + high-support supplements):

- General Fund: $700M annually
- Efficiency Savings: $20M annually
- OLCC Revenue: $30M annually
- **Total: $750M annually** - Meets mid-range with cushion ✅

**Note:** This represents state-funded benefits only. When federal SNAP is operational, eligible households receive federal benefits directly through the federal program in addition to state benefits, providing total benefit levels that exceed these state-only amounts.

(b) **Economic Multiplier Effects**

Research demonstrates that every dollar invested in food assistance generates substantial economic activity through local spending:

**Primary Multiplier Effect:**

- **$1.00 in food assistance → $1.50-$2.00 in economic activity**
- **OFAP Annual Impact** (at $750M funding): $960 million - $1.7 billion in economic activity
- **OFAP Biennial Impact** (at $1.5B funding): $2.25 billion - $3.0 billion in economic activity

**Multiplier Breakdown:**

- Local retail spending: 85-90% of benefits spent immediately
- Agricultural sector support: 15-20% of spending goes to local farmers/producers
- Job creation: Food distribution, retail, and agricultural employment
- Tax revenue generation: $50-100 million annually from economic activity
  - State income tax: $30-60 million annually
  - Local sales/use taxes: $10-20 million annually

**Economic Return on Investment:**

- **Program Cost**: $750 million annually (mid-range)
- **Economic Activity Generated**: $960 million - $1.7 billion annually
- **Tax Revenue Generated**: $50-100 million annually
- **Net Economic Benefit**: $260 million - $1.05 billion annually
- **ROI**: 135-240% return on investment

(c) **Healthcare Cost Savings Projections**

Food insecurity directly contributes to increased healthcare utilization and costs. Research demonstrates that food assistance programs significantly reduce healthcare expenditures:

**Annual Healthcare Cost Savings: $100-200 million**

**Savings Breakdown:**

1. **Reduced Emergency Room Visits**: $25-50 million annually

   - Food insecure individuals have 30-50% higher ER utilization

- Long-term savings: Prevented chronic conditions save significantly more over time

**Healthcare Savings ROI:**

- Program investment: $750 million annually
- Healthcare savings: $100-200 million annually
- Net program cost after savings: $550-650 million annually
- Savings represent 13-27% reduction in net program cost

(d) **Additional Cost Savings and Economic Benefits**

**Workforce Productivity Improvements**: $20-40 million annually

- Reduced absenteeism due to health issues

**Net Economic Benefit**: $470 million - $1.47 billion annually

**Return on Investment**: 163-296% annually

(f) **Funding Sustainability and Bipartisan Appeal**

**Why This Funding Structure Achieves Broad Bipartisan Support:**

1. **Fiscal Conservatives Support Because:**

   - Uses existing General Fund (no new taxes)
   - Generates positive ROI ($470M-$1.47B net benefit annually)
   - Strong oversight and cost controls (5% admin cap)
   - Efficiency savings built in ($15-30M annually)
   - Reduces healthcare costs (saves $100-200M annually)

2. **Progressives Support Because:**

   - Dedicated funding ensures program sustainability
   - Addresses fundamental human need (food security)
   - Reduces poverty and inequality
   - Supports children and families
   - Economic benefits help local communities

3. **Business Community Support Because:**

   - Economic activity generates $960M-$1.7B annually
   - Supports local retailers and farmers
   - Reduces healthcare costs (improves workforce health)
   - Creates jobs in food distribution and agriculture
   - Tax revenue generated offsets program costs

4. **Rural Communities Support Because:**

   - Direct support to agricultural sector ($75-150M annually)
   - Market stability for Oregon farmers
   - Job creation in rural areas
   - Economic development through local spending

5. **Urban Communities Support Because:**
   - Food security improves health outcomes
   - Reduces emergency service utilization
   - Supports local grocery retailers
   - Economic multiplier effect benefits local economy

**Budget Context (Demonstrating Manageability):**

- Total State Budget (biennium): $138.9 billion
- General Fund (biennium): $37.3 billion
- OFAP Need (biennium): $1.3-1.5 billion
- **OFAP as % of General Fund: 3.5-4.0%** (highly manageable)
- **OFAP as % of Total Budget: 0.93-1.08%** (extremely small)

This demonstrates that OFAP represents a modest, manageable investment that generates substantial economic returns and achieves broad bipartisan support through multiple funding mechanisms.

## Rationale for Funding Approach

### Strategic Funding Philosophy

**Avoid Tax Increases Where Possible**

- Learning from Measure 118 failure (corporate tax increases rejected)
- Primary reliance on General Fund (existing revenue, no new taxes)
- Supplemental sources are optional, not required
- Emphasis on efficiency and existing resources
- All funding sources prioritize bipartisan support

**Build Broad Bipartisan Support Through Multiple Funding Mechanisms**

**Tier 1 Sources (Highest Support - Required):**

- General Fund ($650-750M annually): Uses existing revenue, appeals to fiscal conservatives and progressives
- Efficiency Savings ($15-30M): Built-in, demonstrates fiscal responsibility

**Note on Federal Funds:**
Federal SNAP benefits are distributed directly to recipients through federal programs and do not flow through the Oregon Food Security Fund. When federal SNAP is operational, eligible households receive federal benefits separately from state-funded benefits, providing comprehensive coverage through dual systems.

**Tier 2 Sources (Moderate Support - Optional):**

- OLCC Revenue ($26-37M): Health connection, growing revenue, moderate-high support
- Lottery Fund ($7-13M): Public program precedent, moderate support
- Tobacco Tax ($5-15M): Health connection, optional supplement

**Appeal to All Constituencies:**

- **Fiscal Conservatives**: No new taxes, positive ROI ($470M-$1.47B net benefit), efficiency controls
- **Progressives**: Dedicated funding, addresses fundamental need, reduces poverty
- **Business Community**: Economic activity ($960M-$1.7B annually), job creation, tax revenue generation
- **Rural Communities**: Agricultural support ($75-150M annually), market stability, job creation
- **Urban Communities**: Health improvements, reduced emergency service costs, local economic benefits

**Flexibility and Sustainability**

- Multiple revenue sources (diversification reduces risk)
- Economic adjustment mechanisms (adapts to economic conditions)
- Reserve fund for emergencies (up to 10% of annual costs)
- Long-term sustainability planning (oversight board ensures continuity)
- Funding structure prioritizes sources with highest bipartisan support

### Why This Approach Works

1. **Primary Funding: General Fund**

   - Uses existing state revenue
   - No new taxes required
   - Legislature maintains control
   - Adjustable based on economic conditions

2. **Oversight and Accountability**

   - Independent board ensures fiscal responsibility
   - Public transparency builds trust
   - Performance metrics demonstrate effectiveness
   - Efficiency requirements control costs

3. **Economic Logic**

   - Food assistance creates economic activity
   - Multiplier effect generates tax revenue
   - Reduces healthcare and social service costs
   - Supports local businesses and farmers

4. **Federal Coordination**
   - Federal benefits distributed directly to recipients (separate from state fund)
   - State fund provides backup when federal funds unavailable
   - Leverages existing infrastructure for administrative efficiency
   - Coordinates to avoid duplication while maintaining separate funding streams

## Arguments for Support

## Funding Estimates

### Initial Program Costs (Estimated)

Based on serving 757,000 Oregonians at 185% poverty level:

- **Annual Benefit Costs**: $600-800 million
  - Assumes average benefit of $200-250/month per household
  - Average household size: 2.2 persons
- **Administrative Costs**: $30-40 million (5% of benefits)
- **System Costs**: $10-15 million annually
- **Total Estimated Annual Cost**: $640-855 million
- **Mid-Range Target**: $750 million annually

### Detailed Funding Sources (Prioritized by Bipartisan Support)

**Tier 1 - Primary Sources (Highest Bipartisan Support):**

- **General Fund**: $650-750 million annually
  - Represents 3.5-4.0% of biennial General Fund
  - Uses existing revenue, no new taxes required
  - Broad bipartisan appeal
- **Efficiency Savings**: $15-30 million annually
  - Built into program design
  - No additional appropriations needed

**Important Note on Federal Funds:**
Federal SNAP benefits ($100-200 million annually when operational) are distributed directly to eligible individuals through the federal program and are NOT deposited into the Oregon Food Security Fund. The state fund operates independently, providing state-funded benefits. When federal SNAP is available, households may receive both federal and state benefits through separate distribution systems.

**Tier 2 - Supplemental Sources (Moderate Bipartisan Support):**

- **OLCC Revenue**: $26-37 million annually
  - Cannabis tax (5-7%): $8-12 million
    - **Data Source**: [Oregon Department of Revenue - Marijuana Tax Statistics](https://www.oregon.gov/dor/gov-research/pages/default.aspx)
  - Liquor revenue (5-7%): $18-25 million
  - Requires legislative approval
- **Lottery Fund**: $7-13 million annually
  - 3-5% of net lottery revenue
  - Requires ballot measure or legislative approval
- **Transient Lodging Tax**: $15-30 million annually (optional)
  - **Data Source**: [Oregon Department of Revenue - Lodging Tax Report](https://www.oregon.gov/dor/gov-research/pages/default.aspx)
  - State transient lodging tax statistics available by region and accommodation type
  - Legislative allocation if approved
- **Tobacco Tax**: $5-15 million annually (optional)
  - **Data Source**: [Oregon Department of Revenue - Research Reports](https://www.oregon.gov/dor/gov-research/pages/default.aspx)
  - Currently allocated to health programs
  - Legislative allocation if approved

**Total Available Funding**: $718-895 million annually (exceeds program need)

**Note on Department of Revenue Data:**
The Oregon Department of Revenue provides comprehensive tax statistics and research reports including:
