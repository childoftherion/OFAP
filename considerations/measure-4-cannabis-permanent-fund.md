## Full Text (Proposed)

### Article XV, Section 19 - Oregon Cannabis Permanent Fund

**Subsection (1) - Fund Established**

There is established the Oregon Cannabis Permanent Fund, a constitutionally protected permanent fund in the State Treasury, separate and distinct from the General Fund.

**Subsection (2) - Funding Source**

(a) At least 10% of all cannabis tax revenues collected by the Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission from commercial cannabis operations pursuant to ORS chapter 475C (Oregon cannabis tax laws) shall be deposited into the permanent fund principal.

(b) All licensing fees and application fees collected by the Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission from commercial cannabis businesses shall be deposited into the permanent fund principal.

(c) The principal of the fund may not be spent except as authorized by constitutional amendment approved by voters.

(d) This amendment does not authorize any new taxes, tax rate increases, or new fees. The fund shall be funded entirely from existing cannabis tax revenues and fees that are already being collected.

**Subsection (3) - Management**

The fund shall be managed by the Oregon Cannabis Permanent Fund Corporation, an independent board established by law. The corporation shall:

(a) Consist of 7-9 members appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate
(b) Employ professional investment managers
(c) Maintain a diversified investment portfolio
(d) Report annually to the Legislature and Governor on fund performance
(e) Make all financial statements publicly available

**Subsection (4) - Earnings Distribution**

**Subsection (6) - Private Industry Preserved**

This amendment does not authorize state ownership or operation of cannabis businesses. The private commercial cannabis industry shall continue operating under existing regulatory framework established by law. This amendment only allocates existing tax revenues and fees to the permanent fund.

**Subsection (7) - Implementation**

The Legislature shall enact enabling legislation to:

(a) Establish the Oregon Cannabis Permanent Fund Corporation
(b) Define the investment strategy and portfolio allocation
(c) Establish the initial earnings distribution method
(d) Provide for annual deposits from existing cannabis tax revenues and fees

## Rationale for Constitutional Approach

### Precedent: Alaska Permanent Fund (1976-Present, 48+ Years)

- Successfully established permanent fund from natural resource revenues
- Constitutional protection prevented legislative raids
- Grew to $64-80 billion, providing $1,600+ annual dividends per resident
- Demonstrates permanent funds can succeed long-term with constitutional protection

### Precedent: Oregon Common School Fund (1859-Present, 165+ Years)

- **Oregon's Own Success**: Oregon has successfully managed a constitutionally protected permanent fund for 165+ years
- **Public Trust**: Oregonians understand and support constitutionally protected permanent funds
- **Proven Model**: Common School Fund demonstrates constitutional protection works in Oregon
- **Management Expertise**: State has proven ability to manage permanent funds professionally
- **See**: [Oregon Common School Fund Documentation](../Examples/oregon-common-school-fund.md)

### Supporting Evidence: State Permanent Funds

Multiple states have successfully established and maintained constitutionally protected permanent funds:

- **Alaska Permanent Fund** (1976-Present, 48+ years): $64-80 billion fund demonstrates constitutional protection provides permanence
- **Texas Permanent School Fund** (1854-Present, 170+ years): Longest-running permanent fund, demonstrates long-term success
- **North Dakota Legacy Fund** (2010-Present, 14+ years): $9.4+ billion accumulated through automatic funding formula
- **Alabama Trust Fund** (1985-Present, 39+ years): Constitutional protection provides long-term stability
- **Cautionary Example - West Virginia Future Fund** (2014-2023): Statutory-only program closed after 9 years, demonstrating need for constitutional protection

**See**: [Supporting Evidence Summary](../Examples/supporting-evidence-summary.md) for comprehensive analysis of all permanent fund examples.

### Advantages

1. **Permanent Framework**: Constitutional amendments are more durable than statutes - proven by 48-170+ years of successful operation in other states
2. **Principal Protection**: Principal cannot be spent without voter approval, ensuring fund grows over time
3. **Earnings Protection**: Earnings protected from reallocation to education, health, or general fund
4. **Public Control**: Voter approval required for any changes to earnings distribution
5. **Public Trust**: Constitutional status builds public confidence - Oregon Common School Fund demonstrates this works in Oregon
6. **NO NEW TAXES**: Fund uses only existing revenues already being collected

## NO NEW TAXES - 100% from Existing Revenues

### Key Principle

The Oregon Cannabis Permanent Fund is funded **entirely from existing revenues** that are already being collected from Oregon's commercial cannabis industry. **No new taxes are required, no tax rates are increased, and no new fees are imposed.**

### Current Revenue Structure (Unchanged)

**Existing Revenue Streams:**

- **17% Retail Tax**: Existing tax rate on recreational cannabis sales - NO INCREASE
- **Licensing Fees**: Existing annual fees from cannabis businesses - NO NEW FEES
- **Application Fees**: Existing fees for new applications and renewals - NO NEW FEES
- **All Revenues Already Collected**: OLCC currently collects ~$315-350 million annually (based on actual 2024-2025 data)

**Revenue Figures (Updated Based on Official DOR Data - October 2025):**

- **Cannabis Tax Revenue (17% tax)**: ~$290-310 million annually (2024-2025 actuals)
  - **2024 Actual**: $312.6 million (based on official DOR quarterly distribution data)
  - **2025 Projected**: ~$289.6 million (based on first 3 quarters)
  - **Trend**: Revenue peaked in 2021 at $374.7M, now stabilizing around $290-310M annually
  - **See**: [Sources Analysis](../State-budget/sources/marijuana-tax-analysis.md) for detailed breakdown
- **Licensing Fees**: $20-30 million annually (estimated, not in distribution data)
- **Application Fees & Other**: $5-10 million annually (estimated)
- **Total OLCC Cannabis Revenue**: ~$315-350 million annually

**Source**: Oregon Department of Revenue - Cannabis Tax Statistics, OLCC Budget Documents

### Proposed Fund Allocation

**Recommended Allocation (NO NEW TAXES):**

- **10% of Existing Tax Revenue**: ~$29-31 million annually (10% of $290-310M, based on actual 2024-2025 data)
  - Source: Reallocate small percentage from existing distributions
  - Impact: Minimal reduction (each program reduced by 10%)
- **All Existing Licensing Fees**: $20-30 million annually
  - Source: Existing fees, reallocated from OLCC operations
  - Impact: OLCC operations funded from alternative source
- **Total Annual Deposits**: ~$49-61 million annually (10% tax revenue + all licensing fees)
- **No New Taxes**: 100% from existing revenues already being collected

**Tax Impact: ZERO**

- 17% tax rate remains unchanged
- No new taxes created
- No tax increases required
- Fund grows from existing revenue streams

### Current Distribution (Statutory)

Cannabis tax revenue is statutorily mandated to be distributed as follows (2025-2027 projections):

- **State School Fund**: 40% = $67.8 million annually
- **Mental Health/Addiction Services**: 20% = $33.9 million annually
- **State Police**: 15% = $25.4 million annually
- **Counties**: 10% = $17.0 million annually
- **Cities**: 10% = $17.0 million annually
- **OLCC Operations**: 5% = $8.5 million annually

**Note**: With 10% allocation to permanent fund, existing programs would receive 90% of current amounts (e.g., Education: $61.0M instead of $67.8M).

## Arguments for Support

- **Long-term Growth**: Fund grows over decades, providing increasing benefits

### Fiscal Responsibility

- **NO NEW TAXES**: Uses only existing revenues already being collected
- **Principal Protection**: Principal cannot be spent, ensuring fund continues growing
- **Professional Management**: Independent corporation ensures efficient investment management
- **Public Accountability**: Annual reporting and transparency requirements

### Future Generations

- **Long-term Investment**: Fund grows over decades, benefiting future Oregonians
- **Permanent Asset**: Converts existing revenues into permanent financial asset
- **Intergenerational Equity**: Current generation establishes fund for future generations
- **Growing Benefits**: Earnings increase as fund grows

### Public Control

- **Voter Protection**: Principal and earnings protected by constitutional requirement for voter approval
- **Transparency**: All changes require public vote and debate
- **No Legislative Raids**: Legislature cannot divert funds without voter consent

- The 17% tax rate remains unchanged
- No tax increases are needed or authorized
- Fund grows from revenues already being collected

### "Reduces Education/Health Funding"

**Response**:

- Only 10% allocation minimizes impact on existing programs

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Authority

- **States Have Authority**: States have broad authority to establish permanent funds (see Alaska, Texas, Oregon Common School Fund)
- **Revenue Allocation**: Constitutional amendment can establish how existing revenues are allocated
- **No Federal Conflict**: Uses state-collected revenues, no federal preemption concerns
- **Compliant with ORS**: Works within existing statutory framework for cannabis taxation (ORS 475C.540)

### Compliance with Oregon Law

**Existing Cannabis Tax Law (ORS Chapter 475C):**

- Current 17% tax rate established by statute (ORS 475C.540)
- Distribution formula established by ORS 475C.726
- Constitutional amendment allocates portion of existing statutory revenues
- Does not change tax rate or create new taxes
- Complies with existing regulatory framework
- Works within existing OLCC authority to collect taxes and fees

**Constitutional Amendment Requirements:**

- Majority vote required for passage
- Takes effect upon approval
- Requires enabling legislation for implementation
- Complies with Oregon Constitution Article XV structure

### Potential Legal Challenges

- **Low Risk**: Similar to Alaska Permanent Fund, which has operated successfully for 48+ years
- **Constitutional Precedent**: Oregon Common School Fund demonstrates Oregon's support for permanent funds
- **Revenue Allocation**: Constitutional amendments can establish revenue allocation (precedent exists)
- **No Tax Increase**: Using existing revenues avoids tax increase legal challenges

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Constitutional Amendment Approval (Election Day)

1. **Ballot Measure**: Voter approval of constitutional amendment
2. **Effective Date**: Amendment takes effect upon approval
3. **Enabling Legislation Required**: Legislature must pass implementation legislation

### Phase 2: Implementation (Year 1-2)

1. **Legislation**: Legislature enacts enabling legislation establishing:

   - Oregon Cannabis Permanent Fund Corporation
   - Board composition and appointment process
   - Investment strategy and portfolio allocation
   - Initial earnings distribution method

2. **Corporation Establishment**:

   - Create Oregon Cannabis Permanent Fund Corporation
   - Appoint and confirm board members (7-9 members)
   - Hire professional investment staff

   - Begin automatic deposits of all licensing fees ($20-30M annually)
   - Total: ~$49-61 million annually deposited to fund

### Phase 3: Fund Growth (Years 2+)

1. **Regular Deposits**: Automatic deposits continue from OLCC revenues
2. **Investment Management**: Professional management grows fund
3. **Fund Growth**: Fund grows through deposits and investment returns
4. **Earnings Distribution**: Begin distributing earnings once fund reaches sufficient size (typically after 5-10 years of growth)

- **Oregon Precedent**: "Oregon Common School Fund proves permanent funds work"
- **Direct Benefits**: "Dividends benefit all Oregonians directly"
- **Future Generations**: "Investment for future Oregonians"

## Key Messages

### "NO NEW TAXES - Uses Only Existing Revenues"

- Fund uses existing 17% tax rate - no increase
- Uses existing licensing fees - no new fees
- 100% from revenues already being collected
- Zero tax impact on consumers or businesses

### "Oregon Can Do What Alaska Did"

- Uses existing commercial industry, no state ownership needed

### "Oregon Precedent: Common School Fund"

- Oregon has managed permanent funds for 165+ years
- Oregonians understand and support permanent funds
- Constitutional protection works in Oregon
- State has proven ability to manage permanent funds

### "Strong Protections Prevent Fund Raids"

- Earnings protected from reallocation to education, health, or general fund

## Constitutional Requirements

- **Type**: Constitutional Amendment
- **Vote Requirement**: Majority vote to pass
- **Effective Date**: Takes effect upon approval
- **Enabling Legislation**: Legislature must pass enabling legislation
- **Implementation**: Fund begins receiving deposits upon implementation

## Next Steps After Approval

1. **Legislature Must Pass Enabling Legislation**:

   - Establish Oregon Cannabis Permanent Fund Corporation
   - Define board composition and appointment process
   - Establish investment strategy
   - Define initial earnings distribution method

2. **Corporation Establishment**:

   - Create Oregon Cannabis Permanent Fund Corporation
   - Appoint and confirm board members
   - Hire professional investment staff

3. **Revenue Allocation Begins**:

   - Automatic deposits of 10% of tax revenue begin
   - Automatic deposits of all licensing fees begin
   - Fund begins growing through deposits and investments

4. **Long-term Growth**:
   - Fund grows over decades
   - Earnings distribution begins after sufficient fund growth
   - Oregonians begin receiving dividends or other benefits

## Relationship to Other Measures

This measure is **independent** but **complementary** to Measures 1, 2, and 3:

- **Measure 1**: Establishes food security as fundamental right
- **Measure 2**: Creates Oregon Food Assistance Program
- **Measure 3**: Creates Oregon Food Security Fund (General Fund based)
- **Measure 4**: Creates separate Cannabis Permanent Fund (revenue-based permanent fund)

**Key Difference**: Measure 4 creates a permanent endowment fund from cannabis revenues that grows over time and could eventually provide dividends or other benefits to all Oregonians, while Measures 1-3 focus specifically on food assistance programs.

**Compatibility**: All measures can coexist. Measure 4's permanent fund could eventually provide earnings that supplement or complement food assistance programs, but earnings cannot be directly allocated to food programs without voter approval (due to earnings protection provisions).

## Conclusion

The Oregon Cannabis Permanent Fund Amendment would create a constitutionally protected permanent fund from **existing commercial cannabis revenues (NO NEW TAXES)**, similar to how Alaska created the Alaska Permanent Fund from oil revenues. By dedicating a portion (10%) of existing cannabis tax revenues and all existing licensing fees to a permanent fund, Oregon could:

1. **Create Multi-Billion Dollar Fund**: Build $3-4 billion fund over 25-30 years
2. **Benefit All Oregonians**: Universal dividends or direct payment programs
3. **Long-term Stability**: Permanent revenue source for future generations
4. **Follow Proven Model**: Alaska Permanent Fund demonstrates success
5. **Maintain Private Industry**: Commercial cannabis industry continues operating unchanged
6. **Strong Protections**: Earnings protected from reallocation, public vote required for changes
7. **NO NEW TAXES**: Funded 100% from existing revenues already being collected

**Funding Source (NO NEW TAXES):**

- Existing 17% Tax Rate: No tax increase required
- Existing Licensing Fees: Redirection of fees already being collected
- Recommended Allocation: 10% of tax revenue (~$29-31M, based on actual 2024-2025 data) + all fees ($20-30M) = ~$49-61M annually

**⚠️ IMPORTANT UPDATE**: Revenue figures have been updated based on official Oregon Department of Revenue data downloaded October 2025. Actual cannabis tax distributions are ~$290-310M annually (2024-2025), significantly higher than previous estimates. See [Sources Analysis](../State-budget/sources/marijuana-tax-analysis.md) for detailed breakdown.

- 100% from Existing Revenue: No new taxes, no tax increases, no new fees

This proposal applies the Alaska Permanent Fund model to cannabis revenues while maintaining Oregon's existing commercial cannabis industry structure and **existing 17% tax rate**. The strong constitutional protections ensure the fund cannot be raided to replace existing state funding obligations, guaranteeing that earnings benefit Oregonians directly for generations to come.
