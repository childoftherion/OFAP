# Oregon Food Security Ballot Measure: Overview and Strategy

## Current Crisis Context

Oregon is experiencing a severe food security crisis:

- **757,000 Oregonians** depend on SNAP benefits that have been disrupted due to federal government shutdown
- Governor Tina Kotek has declared a **60-day food security emergency**
- State allocated $5 million to food banks as emergency response
- **Critical need**: Establish a state-funded program independent of federal funding fluctuations

## Strategic Approach for Wide Public Support

### Lessons from Oregon Ballot Measure History

**Successful Precedent: Measure 111 (2022)**

- Established healthcare as a fundamental right in Oregon Constitution
- **Key Success Factor**: Framed as a fundamental right, not just a benefit
- Received broad bipartisan support by emphasizing moral imperative and economic benefits

**Failed Precedent: Measure 118 (2022)**

- Proposed corporate tax increases
- **Failure Factor**: Perceived as punitive taxation
- Heavy business opposition led to defeat

### Principles for This Proposal

1. **Frame as Fundamental Right**: Similar to Measure 111, position food security as a fundamental human right
2. **Avoid Punitive Taxation**: Use existing revenue streams and economic growth strategies rather than new corporate taxes
3. **Emphasize State Sovereignty**: Independence from federal funding creates stability
4. **Show Economic Benefits**: Demonstrate job creation, healthcare cost savings, and economic multiplier effects
5. **Bipartisan Appeal**:
   - Progressives: Moral imperative, social justice
   - Conservatives: State sovereignty, economic efficiency, local control
   - Business Community: Consumer spending, market stability
   - Rural Communities: Agricultural support, local economy

## Proposed Ballot Measures Structure

Three complementary proposals designed to address different aspects of food security while building broad coalition support:

1. **Oregon Food Security Amendment** (Constitutional)

   - Establishes food security as a fundamental right
   - Creates framework for state program

2. **Oregon Food Assistance Program Act** (Statutory)

   - Creates the EBT-style program
   - Defines eligibility, benefits, and administration

3. **Oregon Food Security Fund** (Statutory)
   - Establishes dedicated funding mechanism
   - Creates oversight and accountability measures

## Support-Building Strategy

### Key Messaging for Different Constituencies

**For All Voters:**

- "Protect Oregon families from federal funding disruptions"
- "Ensure no Oregonian goes hungry"
- "Invest in Oregon's food security and economic stability"

**For Rural Communities:**

- "Support Oregon farmers and local agriculture"
- "Keep food dollars in Oregon communities"
- "Create stable markets for Oregon-grown food"

**For Urban Communities:**

- "Address food deserts and improve access to healthy food"
- "Reduce healthcare costs through better nutrition"
- "Support working families and children"

**For Business Community:**

- "Increase consumer spending in local businesses"
- "Support economic stability and predictability"
- "Create jobs in agriculture, distribution, and retail sectors"

### Economic Arguments

- **Multiplier Effect**: Every $1 in food assistance generates $1.50-$2.00 in economic activity
- **Healthcare Savings**: Reduced food insecurity leads to lower healthcare costs
- **Educational Outcomes**: Better nutrition improves student performance
- **Workforce Productivity**: Well-nourished workers are more productive

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Phase 1** (Months 1-3): Constitutional amendment and program framework
2. **Phase 2** (Months 4-12): System development and infrastructure
3. **Phase 3** (Year 2): Phased rollout by county/region
4. **Phase 4** (Year 3): Full statewide implementation
