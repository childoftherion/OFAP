## Rationale for Statutory Approach

### Advantages

1. **Flexibility**: Statutes can be adjusted by Legislature as needed
2. **Detailed Framework**: Allows comprehensive program design
3. **Coordination**: Can integrate with existing systems
4. **Accountability**: Clear oversight and reporting requirements

### Strategic Positioning

- Works with Constitutional Amendment (Measure 1) to create complete framework
- Can stand alone if Constitutional Amendment does not pass
- Provides specific implementation details

## Support-Building Elements

### Broad Eligibility (185% of poverty)

- Serves working families, not just very poor
- Includes many voters who may directly benefit
- Aligns with Oregon values of supporting working families

### All Residents Included

- No immigration status restrictions (following "Food for All Oregonians" model)
- Appeals to progressive voters
- Recognizes contributions of all Oregon residents

### Local Food Support

- Appeals to agricultural communities
- Supports Oregon economy
- Creates bipartisan support

### Efficient Administration

- 5% cap on administrative costs
- Modern EBT system (proven technology)
- Fraud prevention built in

### Economic Benefits Emphasis

- Creates jobs
- Stimulates local economy
- Reduces healthcare costs
- Supports education outcomes

## Potential Modifications for Broader Support

### Option A: More Restrictive Eligibility

- Lower income threshold (150% instead of 185%)
- Asset limits
- Work requirements for able-bodied adults

**Pros**: Lower cost, appeals to fiscal conservatives
**Cons**: Excludes working families, reduces support base

### Option B: Phased Eligibility

- Phase 1: Current SNAP-eligible population
- Phase 2: Expand to 185% after program stability established

**Pros**: Lower initial cost, demonstrates effectiveness first
**Cons**: Delays full implementation

### Option C: County Opt-In

- Allow counties to opt into program
- State provides funding for participating counties

**Pros**: Local control appeal, reduces statewide cost
**Cons**: Creates inequity, administrative complexity

## Recommended Approach

**Support Option B (Phased Eligibility)** as compromise that:

- Demonstrates program effectiveness
- Builds public confidence
- Allows for expansion based on results
- Maintains broad eligibility goal
