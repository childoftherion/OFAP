## Title

**Oregon Food Assistance Program Act**

## Short Ballot Title

"Establishes universal state-funded food assistance program; creates OFAP cards restricted to authorized food items only"

## Summary

This measure establishes the Oregon Food Assistance Program (OFAP), a state-funded universal program that provides monthly food benefits to all eligible Oregon residents using OFAP cards (restricted purchase cards). OFAP cards can only be used to purchase authorized food items for home consumption, including staples, raw ingredients, seeds, and food-bearing plants. The program operates independently of federal funding to ensure continuity during federal disruptions. Eligibility is universal for all United States citizens who are natural persons and full-time residents of Oregon, regardless of income. Benefits are determined by household size using federal Thrifty Food Plan standards, with no income-based reductions.

## Rationale for Purchase Restrictions

### Why Restrict Purchases to Authorized Food Items?

**Health and Nutrition Benefits:**

- Encourages consumption of whole, unprocessed foods
- Promotes home cooking, which is generally more nutritious
- Prevents spending on processed snacks and convenience foods
- Supports better dietary choices through structural limits

**Fiscal Responsibility:**

- Ensures benefits are used for nutritional foods, not luxury items
- Prevents misuse of public funds on non-essential purchases
- Encourages economical food preparation (staples and raw ingredients)
- Maximizes nutritional value per dollar spent

**Agricultural Support:**

- Directly supports Oregon farmers through purchases of raw ingredients
- Encourages seed and plant purchases, supporting local nurseries
- Promotes local food systems and sustainable agriculture
- Creates demand for Oregon-grown staples and produce

**Program Integrity:**

- Ensures public funds are used for intended purpose (food security)
- Builds public trust through transparent purchase restrictions
- Prevents potential abuse while maintaining dignity
- Demonstrates fiscal responsibility to taxpayers

## Rationale for Statutory Approach

### Advantages

1. **Flexibility**: Statutes can be adjusted by Legislature as needed
2. **Detailed Framework**: Allows comprehensive program design including purchase restrictions
3. **Coordination**: Can integrate with existing systems and point-of-sale technology
4. **Accountability**: Clear oversight and reporting requirements

### Strategic Positioning

- Works with Constitutional Amendment (Measure 1) to create complete framework
- Can stand alone if Constitutional Amendment does not pass
- Provides specific implementation details

## Support-Building Elements

- Simplified eligibility reduces administrative costs
- Ensures no one falls through cracks due to income thresholds

### Natural Person Requirement

- Only natural persons (individuals) eligible - excludes corporations and legal entities
- Prevents abuse by artificial entities
- Ensures benefits go to actual people

### Full-Time Residency Requirement

- Ensures benefits go to Oregon residents, not temporary visitors
- 183+ days per year requirement prevents gaming the system
- Protects Oregon's financial resources for Oregonians

### Purchase Restrictions Ensure Proper Use

- OFAP cards restricted to authorized food items only (staples, raw ingredients, seeds, plants)

- Encourages home cooking and healthy eating habits
- Supports Oregon agricultural sector through purchases of authorized food items (staples, raw ingredients, seeds, plants)

## Potential Modifications for Broader Support

## Universal Eligibility Rationale

### Why Universal Eligibility?

**Cost Considerations:**

- Streamlines application process
- Reduces eligibility worker needs

**Equity Benefits:**

- No one excluded based on income

- Treats all citizens equally

**Economic Benefits:**

- Universal benefits create predictable consumer spending
- All residents contribute to local food economy
- Reduces stigma associated with means-tested programs
- Supports Oregon agricultural sector across all income levels

### Implementation Considerations

- Higher total program cost due to universal eligibility
- Simpler administration may offset some costs
- Benefits are universal but fixed by household size (no income-based sliding scale)
- Citizenship and residency verification required for all applicants
