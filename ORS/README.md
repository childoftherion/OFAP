## Key Themes and Connections to OFAP

### 1. Department of Human Services as Lead Agency

Multiple statutes (ORS 411.825, ORS 458.530) designate DHS as the appropriate agency for administering food assistance programs. OFAP proposals align with this by designating DHS as the administering agency.

### 2. Universal Access Philosophy

- **ORS 458.530**: "All persons have the right to be free from hunger"
- **ORS 327.537**: Requires providing meals regardless of ability to pay
- These statutes support OFAP's universal eligibility approach

### 3. Food Security as State Policy

**ORS 458.530** explicitly declares food security as state policy and defines it as: "Persons lack food security if they are uncertain of having, or being able to acquire in socially acceptable ways, enough acceptable food at all times to meet basic needs because they have insufficient money or other resources for food."

This aligns perfectly with OFAP's mission to ensure food security for all Oregon residents.

### 4. Administrative Framework

Statutes in Chapter 411 establish:

- Uniform statewide standards (ORS 411.070)
- Eligibility determination processes (ORS 411.816)
- Distribution mechanisms (ORS 411.825)
- Compliance requirements (ORS 411.837)

OFAP would operate within this established framework.

### Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (Chapter 412)

#### ORS 412.009 - Engagement in JOBS; disqualification; rules

**File**: [ors_412.009.md](ors_412.009.md)  
**Summary**: Establishes requirements for participation in job opportunity and basic skills (JOBS) program, with provisions addressing food security impacts of disqualifications.

**Relevance to OFAP**: Recognizes that loss of income from program disqualifications affects "health and food security of dependent children" - directly relevant to OFAP's mission to ensure food security.

### Women, Infants, and Children Program (Chapter 413)

#### ORS 413.500 - Women, Infants and Children Program; rules; civil penalties

**File**: [ors_413.500.md](ors_413.500.md)  
**Summary**: Establishes WIC program in Oregon Health Authority to provide nutritious food, nutrition education, health screening, and referral services to pregnant/breastfeeding women, infants, and children in high-risk categories.

**Relevance to OFAP**: Demonstrates another state-administered nutrition program, though WIC is federally funded. Shows Oregon's commitment to supplemental nutrition programs.

### Cannabis/Marijuana Tax (Chapter 475C)

#### ORS 475C.540 - Definitions for ORS 475C.540 to 475C.586

**File**: [ors_475C.540.md](ors_475C.540.md)  
**Summary**: Provides definitions for cannabis/marijuana tax provisions, including terms related to marijuana items, processing, and production.

**Relevance to OFAP**: Measure 4 proposes using cannabis tax revenues for permanent fund. This statute defines key terms used in cannabis taxation.

#### ORS 475C.726 - Oregon Marijuana Account

**File**: [ors_475C.726.md](ors_475C.726.md)  
**Summary**: Establishes Oregon Marijuana Account and distribution formula. Transfers include: 20% to cities/counties, 80% for state uses (40% State School Fund, 20% mental health/drug treatment, 15% State Police, 5% alcohol/drug abuse services). Excess over $11.25M goes to Drug Treatment and Recovery Services Fund.

**Relevance to OFAP**: ⭐ **CRITICAL STATUTE** for Measure 4 - Shows current distribution of cannabis tax revenues. Measure 4 would redirect at least 10% to the Cannabis Permanent Fund for OFAP. Demonstrates existing precedent for dedicating cannabis tax revenues to specific purposes.

### Ballot Measures and Elections (Chapter 250)

#### ORS 250.035 - Form of ballot titles for state and local measures

**File**: [ors_250.035.md](ors_250.035.md)  
**Summary**: Establishes requirements for ballot titles, including caption (15 words for state measures), result statements (25 words each for yes/no), and summary (125 words).

**Relevance to OFAP**: Referenced in compliance review as relevant for ballot title requirements. All four OFAP measures must comply with these ballot title formatting requirements.

### Public Funds Administration (Chapter 293)

#### ORS 293.560 - Apportionment among counties of moneys received from federal government from forest reserves

**File**: [ors_293.560.md](ors_293.560.md)  
**Summary**: Provides example of "continuous appropriation" mechanism - funds are "continuously appropriated" to department to meet expenses.

**Relevance to OFAP**: Measure 3 uses "continuous appropriation" language for the Oregon Food Security Fund. This statute demonstrates precedent for continuous appropriation mechanisms in Oregon law.

### Residency Requirements

**Status**: Residency requirements for public benefits may be defined in administrative rules (OAR) rather than ORS. OFAP measures define "full-time resident" as maintaining Oregon as primary residence for more than 183 days per year, which aligns with common tax and benefit program definitions.

### Constitutional Provisions

**Status**: Constitutional provisions are not in ORS but in the Oregon Constitution. Measure 1 proposes adding Article I, Section 47; Measure 4 proposes adding Article XV, Section 19. Existing constitutional provisions (like Article XI on education funds, Article IX on Common School Fund) provide precedent for permanent funds.

## How to Use These Statutes

1. **Compliance Review**: Use when reviewing OFAP ballot measures for legal compliance
2. **Program Design**: Reference when designing administrative procedures and eligibility criteria
3. **Legislative Advocacy**: Cite when building support for OFAP measures
4. **Implementation Planning**: Use to understand existing DHS administrative frameworks
