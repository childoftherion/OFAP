(1)Except for a distribution charge that shall be deducted to meet expenses incurred by the Oregon Department of Administrative Services in administering this section, all sums received by the state from the United States Government as its distributive share of the amounts collected by the United States Government for forest reserve rentals, sales of timber, and other sources from forest reserves within the State of Oregon, shall, upon receipt, be distributed among the several counties in which such forest reserves are located. The distribution charge shall be 60 cents per county and is in addition to the transaction charge approved for the department during the budgetary process. The amount of the distribution charges is continuously appropriated to the department to meet expenses incurred in administering this section.

(2)The department shall ascertain from the proper United States officers having the records of receipts from forest reserves, the amount of receipts from each forest reserve in this state for each year for which money is received by the state, less the share of each forest reserve of the deduction made under subsection (1) of this section. A separate account shall be kept of the sum, less the deduction, received from each forest reserve, which sum shall be paid only to the county or counties in which the forest reserve is located. Each county shall receive such proportional amount of the sum as the area of the forest reserve included within the boundaries of the county bears to the total area of the forest reserve within the state. The department shall in all cases when possible make all computations upon the net areas of such forest reserves according to the data furnished by the federal officials.
