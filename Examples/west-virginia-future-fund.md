# West Virginia Future Fund

## Overview

The West Virginia Future Fund provides important lessons about the challenges and opportunities of establishing state permanent funds, including both successful design elements and the risks of political changes.

## History and Establishment

- **Established**: 2014
- **Constitutional Protection**: Statutory (not constitutional)
- **Initial Purpose**: Create perpetual source of state revenue from natural gas and oil severance taxes
- **Funding Formula**: 25% of natural gas and oil severance tax revenues
- **Status**: Permanently closed in 2023 due to legislative changes

## Structure and Management

### Governance (During Operation)

- **Managed By**: West Virginia State Treasurer
- **Oversight**: Board of trustees (during operation)
- **Investment Strategy**: Professional investment management
- **Intended Distribution**: Earnings intended to fund education, economic development, and infrastructure

### Funding Sources

- **Primary Source**: 25% of oil and gas severance tax revenues
- **Intended Use**: Earnings for education, economic development, infrastructure
- **Protection**: Principal was intended to be protected, only earnings spent

## Financial Performance

### Fund Size

- **Operational Period**: 2014-2023
- **Peak Deposits**: Limited due to late-stage oil/gas boom and early closure
- **Final Status**: Fund closed with minimal or no assets remaining
- **Duration**: Operated for approximately 9 years before closure

### Distribution Model

- **Intended Model**: Earnings distributed to education, economic development, infrastructure
- **Actual Implementation**: Limited distributions due to fund's short lifespan
- **Closure Impact**: Fund closed before reaching significant size

## Reasons for Closure (2023)

### Legislative Changes

- **Primary Cause**: Legislative action halted future contributions
- **Political Factors**: Changes in political priorities and budget pressures
- **Severance Tax Changes**: Modifications to severance tax structure
- **Statutory vs. Constitutional**: Statutory establishment made fund vulnerable to legislative changes

### Lessons from Closure

- **Constitutional Protection Matters**: Statutory funds more vulnerable to elimination
- **Political Stability Required**: Need for broad, sustained political support
- **Timing Challenges**: Established late in resource boom, limiting growth potential
- **Public Support**: Limited public awareness may have reduced resistance to closure

## What Worked (Positive Lessons)

### 1. Clear Purpose and Structure

- **Design**: Well-designed funding formula and structure
- **Intent**: Clear purpose (education, economic development, infrastructure)
- **Model**: Followed successful models from other states
- **Framework**: Professional management structure planned

### 2. Funding Formula

- **Automatic Deposit**: Percentage-based formula provided automatic funding
- **Predictability**: Formula-based approach reduces political discretion
- **Transparency**: Clear funding mechanism

### 3. Professional Management Plan

- **Oversight**: Professional board structure planned
- **Investment Strategy**: Professional investment management intended
- **Accountability**: Transparent reporting planned

## What Didn't Work (Challenges)

### 1. Statutory vs. Constitutional Status

- **Vulnerability**: Statutory establishment made fund vulnerable to legislative elimination
- **Contrast**: Alaska, North Dakota, Texas funds have constitutional protection
- **Lesson**: Constitutional protection provides stronger permanence

### 2. Late Establishment

- **Timing**: Established late in oil/gas boom, limiting deposit growth
- **Missed Opportunity**: Earlier establishment could have grown fund significantly
- **Lesson**: Early establishment maximizes fund growth potential

### 3. Political Support

- **Limited Support**: May have lacked sufficient broad political support
- **Public Awareness**: Limited public awareness may have reduced resistance to closure
- **Lesson**: Broad public support and awareness essential for sustainability

### 4. Budget Pressures

- **Competing Needs**: State budget pressures competed with fund deposits
- **Short-term Thinking**: Immediate needs took priority over long-term fund
- **Lesson**: Need strong commitment to long-term vision

## Lessons for Oregon Food Assistance Program

### 1. Constitutional Protection is Essential

- **Application**: Measure 1 (constitutional amendment) provides protection West Virginia Future Fund lacked
- **Benefit**: Constitutional status prevents easy elimination
- **Contrast**: West Virginia Future Fund's statutory status made it vulnerable
- **Critical**: Constitutional protection is crucial for permanent programs

### 2. Broad Political Support Required

- **Application**: OFAP needs broad bipartisan support (Measure 1, 2, 3 strategy)
- **Benefit**: Wide support reduces risk of elimination
- **Lesson**: Programs without broad support are vulnerable
- **Strategy**: Multiple constituencies (progressives, conservatives, business, rural) essential

### 3. Early Establishment Maximizes Benefits

- **Application**: OFAP should be established now, not delayed
- **Benefit**: Early establishment builds fund and program stability
- **Lesson**: Delaying permanent fund establishment reduces benefits
- **Urgency**: Current food crisis demonstrates need for immediate action

### 4. Clear Public Purpose Builds Support

- **Application**: OFAP's clear purpose (food security) builds public support
- **Benefit**: Clear benefits create strong public backing
- **Lesson**: Vague purposes reduce support
- **Messaging**: Clear messaging about benefits essential

### 5. Professional Oversight

- **Application**: Measure 3's oversight board provides professional management
- **Benefit**: Professional oversight builds trust and efficiency
- **Lesson**: Professional management structure important for success
- **Accountability**: Transparent oversight builds public confidence

### 6. Multiple Revenue Sources

- **Application**: Measure 3's diversified funding (General Fund, OLCC, Lottery) reduces risk
- **Benefit**: Multiple sources reduce vulnerability to single source elimination
- **Lesson**: Diversified funding provides resilience
- **Flexibility**: Multiple sources adapt to changing conditions

### 7. Public Awareness and Education

- **Application**: Public support strategy builds awareness and support
- **Benefit**: Public awareness creates resistance to elimination
- **Lesson**: Programs with public awareness more likely to survive
- **Engagement**: Public engagement builds lasting support

## Key Takeaways for OFAP

1. **Constitutional Protection is Critical**: West Virginia Future Fund's closure demonstrates need for constitutional protection

2. **Statutory Funds Are Vulnerable**: Constitutional amendment (Measure 1) provides stronger protection

3. **Broad Support Required**: Programs need wide political and public support to survive

4. **Early Action Matters**: Establishing permanent programs early maximizes benefits

5. **Clear Purpose Builds Support**: OFAP's clear food security purpose creates strong backing

6. **Professional Management**: Oversight board provides accountability and trust

7. **Diversified Funding**: Multiple revenue sources reduce vulnerability

8. **Public Engagement**: Awareness and education build lasting support

## Contrast with Successful Funds

### Alaska Permanent Fund

- **Status**: Constitutional (survived 48+ years)
- **Support**: Broad public support through dividends
- **Result**: Thriving fund

### North Dakota Legacy Fund

- **Status**: Constitutional (surviving and growing)
- **Support**: Broad public support
- **Result**: Growing fund

### West Virginia Future Fund

- **Status**: Statutory (closed after 9 years)
- **Support**: Limited support
- **Result**: Eliminated

**Key Lesson**: Constitutional protection and broad support are essential for permanent fund success.
