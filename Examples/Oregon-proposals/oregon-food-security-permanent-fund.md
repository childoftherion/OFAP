# Oregon Food Security Permanent Fund (OFSPF)

## Overview

The Oregon Food Security Permanent Fund (OFSPF) would establish a constitutionally protected permanent fund dedicated to food security programs, similar to how Texas Permanent School Fund supports education. This fund would provide stable, long-term funding for food assistance programs by creating an endowment that grows over time while using earnings to fund food security initiatives.

## Concept: Permanent Fund for Food Security

### Model: Texas Permanent School Fund

- **Texas PSF**: 170+ years of operation, $50+ billion fund
- **Dedicated Purpose**: Permanent fund specifically for public education
- **Land-Based Revenue**: Funded from state-owned land revenues
- **Stable Funding**: Provides consistent funding regardless of economic conditions

### Oregon Food Security Application

- **Dedicated Purpose**: Permanent fund specifically for food security
- **Multiple Revenue Sources**: Initial appropriations, dedicated taxes, land revenues
- **Endowment Model**: Principal grows, earnings fund programs
- **Stability**: Provides food assistance funding regardless of economic conditions

## Proposed Structure

### Constitutional Amendment

**Article XV, Section 20 - Oregon Food Security Permanent Fund**

1. **Establishment**: There is established the Oregon Food Security Permanent Fund, a constitutionally protected permanent fund dedicated to food security programs.

2. **Purpose**: The fund shall provide stable, long-term funding for food assistance programs, nutrition programs, and food security initiatives for Oregon residents.

3. **Principal Protection**: The principal of the fund may not be spent except as authorized by constitutional amendment approved by voters. Only earnings from the fund may be used.

4. **Management**: The fund shall be managed by the Oregon Food Security Permanent Fund Corporation, an independent board with professional investment management.

## Comparison to Direct Appropriation Model

### Current OFAP Approach (Direct Appropriations)

- **Funding**: $650-850 million annually from General Fund
- **Advantages**: Immediate funding, full legislative control
- **Disadvantages**: Vulnerable to budget cuts, annual battles

### Permanent Fund Approach

- **Disadvantages**: Requires initial seed funding; takes time to grow

### Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

- **Permanent Fund**: Provides stable, growing base funding
- **General Fund**: Provides remaining funding needs
- **Advantages**: Best of both models - stability plus flexibility
- **Example**: Fund provides $200M annually, General Fund provides $450-650M annually

## Conclusion

The Oregon Food Security Permanent Fund would create a constitutionally protected permanent fund dedicated to food security programs. By establishing an endowment that grows over time, the fund would provide:

1. **Stable Funding**: Protected from budget cuts and economic downturns
2. **Growing Support**: Earnings increase as fund grows over decades
3. **Long-term Commitment**: Investment for future generations
4. **Dedicated Purpose**: Focused specifically on food security

The fund would supplement (not replace) General Fund appropriations for OFAP, providing stable base funding while allowing flexibility for changing needs. This hybrid approach combines the stability of a permanent fund with the flexibility of annual appropriations.

The proposal requires:

- **Constitutional Amendment**: Establish permanent fund and principal protection
- **Initial Seed Funding**: $1-2 billion appropriation or bond issue
- **Ongoing Revenue Sources**: Dedicated taxes or land revenues
- **Oregon Food Security Permanent Fund Corporation**: Independent management board
- **Voter Approval**: Ballot measure for constitutional amendment

This would create the first permanent fund dedicated specifically to food security, following the proven model of Texas Permanent School Fund but applied to food security programs.
