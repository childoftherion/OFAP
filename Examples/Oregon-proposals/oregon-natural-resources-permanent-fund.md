# Oregon Natural Resources Permanent Fund (ONRPF)

## Overview

The Oregon Natural Resources Permanent Fund (ONRPF) would establish a constitutionally protected permanent fund from revenues generated by Oregon's natural resources, similar to the Alaska Permanent Fund from oil or the North Dakota Legacy Fund from oil and gas. This fund would convert revenues from timber, water resources, minerals, and other natural resources into a permanent endowment that benefits all Oregonians.

## Concept: Permanent Fund from Natural Resource Revenues

### Models

- **Alaska Permanent Fund**: 25% of oil revenues to permanent fund, $64-80 billion fund
- **North Dakota Legacy Fund**: 30% of oil/gas tax revenues, $9.4+ billion fund
- **Oregon Common School Fund**: State land revenues (timber, leases), 165+ years of operation

### Oregon Natural Resources

- **Timber**: Oregon's largest natural resource industry
- **Water Resources**: Water rights, hydroelectric, irrigation
- **Minerals**: Gold, silver, other minerals
- **Recreation**: Public lands generate recreation revenue
- **Fishing**: Commercial and recreational fishing

## Proposed Structure

### Constitutional Amendment

**Article XV, Section 21 - Oregon Natural Resources Permanent Fund**

1. **Establishment**: There is established the Oregon Natural Resources Permanent Fund, a constitutionally protected permanent fund from natural resource revenues.

2. **Funding Requirement**: At least 25% of revenues from the following sources shall be deposited into the permanent fund principal:

   - Timber harvest revenues from state-owned forests
   - Mineral extraction royalties
   - Water resource fees and royalties
   - Public land lease revenues
   - Other natural resource revenues as determined by law

3. **Principal Protection**: The principal of the fund may not be spent except as authorized by constitutional amendment approved by voters.

4. **Management**: The fund shall be managed by the Oregon Natural Resources Permanent Fund Corporation, an independent board with professional investment management.

5. **Earnings Distribution**: Earnings from the fund may be:
   - Distributed to all Oregon residents as annual dividends
   - Used for conservation and environmental programs
   - Used for public education
   - Transferred to state general fund
   - As determined by law

## Revenue Sources

## Potential Modifications

### Higher Allocation

- **Current Proposal**: 25% of revenues
- **Alternative**: 30-40% for faster fund growth
- **Trade-off**: More to fund, less to current uses

### Additional Revenue Sources

- **Education**: 20% of earnings to education

## Conclusion

The Oregon Natural Resources Permanent Fund would convert a portion of natural resource revenues into a constitutionally protected permanent fund. By allocating 25% of timber, mineral, water, and land lease revenues to the fund, Oregon could:

1. **Create Permanent Asset**: Convert resource revenues into renewable financial asset
2. **Benefit Future Generations**: Fund grows over decades, benefiting future Oregonians
3. **Conservation Funding**: Earnings could fund conservation and environmental programs
4. **Economic Stability**: Provides economic buffer and diversification

The proposal requires:

- **Constitutional Amendment**: Establish permanent fund and principal protection
- **Revenue Allocation**: 25% of qualifying natural resource revenues
- **Oregon Natural Resources Permanent Fund Corporation**: Independent management board
- **Voter Approval**: Ballot measure for constitutional amendment

While the fund would start smaller than Alaska's oil-based fund, it would grow over decades through investment returns, eventually providing significant benefits to all Oregonians through dividends or conservation programs.
