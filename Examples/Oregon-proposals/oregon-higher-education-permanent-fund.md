# Oregon Higher Education Permanent Fund (OHEPF)

## Overview

The Oregon Higher Education Permanent Fund (OHEPF) would establish a constitutionally protected permanent fund dedicated to supporting public higher education in Oregon, similar to the Texas Permanent University Fund (PUF) which supports the University of Texas and Texas A&M systems. This fund would provide stable, long-term funding for Oregon's public universities and community colleges through an endowment that grows over time.

## Concept: Permanent Fund for Higher Education

### Model: Texas Permanent University Fund

- **Texas PUF**: 148+ years of operation, $30+ billion fund
- **Dedicated Purpose**: Permanent fund specifically for higher education
- **Land-Based Revenue**: 2.1 million acres of state land dedicated to fund
- **Recipients**: University of Texas System and Texas A&M University System

### Oregon Higher Education Application

- **Dedicated Purpose**: Permanent fund specifically for public higher education
- **Revenue Sources**: State land revenues, dedicated taxes, General Fund appropriations
- **Endowment Model**: Principal grows, earnings fund higher education
- **Recipients**: Oregon's public universities and community colleges

## Proposed Structure

### Constitutional Amendment

**Article XV, Section 22 - Oregon Higher Education Permanent Fund**

1. **Establishment**: There is established the Oregon Higher Education Permanent Fund, a constitutionally protected permanent fund dedicated to public higher education.

2. **Purpose**: The fund shall provide stable, long-term funding for Oregon's public universities, community colleges, and higher education institutions.

3. **Principal Protection**: The principal of the fund may not be spent except as authorized by constitutional amendment approved by voters. Only earnings from the fund may be used.

4. **Management**: The fund shall be managed by the Oregon Higher Education Permanent Fund Corporation, an independent board with professional investment management.

5. **Funding Sources**: The fund shall receive:

   - Revenues from state-owned lands dedicated to the fund
   - Percentage of specific tax revenues (as determined by law)
   - Initial appropriation from General Fund
   - Other revenue sources as authorized by law

6. **Distribution**: Earnings from the fund shall be distributed to public universities and community colleges according to formula established by law.

## Funding Sources

5. **Long-term Growth**: Fund has grown significantly over 148 years

### Oregon Application

1. **Dedicated Resources**: State lands or dedicated tax revenues
2. **Constitutional Protection**: Ensure permanence
3. **OHEPFC**: Independent management corporation
4. **Multiple Recipients**: All public universities and community colleges
5. **Long-term Growth**: Fund grows to provide increasing support

## Key Arguments for Support

### 1. "Invest in Oregon's Future"

- Better-educated workforce benefits state economy
- Research and innovation drive economic development
- Higher education creates opportunities for all Oregonians

### 2. "Reduce Student Debt and Increase Access"

- Fund earnings can reduce tuition burden
- Increased financial aid increases access
- Lower costs benefit students and families

### 3. "Texas Model Proven Successful"

- Texas PUF: 148+ years, $30+ billion fund
- Permanent fund model works for higher education
- Oregon can apply same model

### 4. "Constitutional Protection Ensures Stability"

- Oregon Common School Fund: 165+ years of success
- Constitutional protection ensures permanence
- Principal protection prevents fund raids

### 5. "Hybrid Approach Provides Flexibility"

- Permanent fund provides stable base
- General Fund provides flexibility for changing needs
- Best of both models

## Comparison to Texas PUF

### Similarities

- Both dedicated to higher education
- Both constitutionally protected
- Both use land or dedicated resource revenues
- Both provide stable, long-term funding

### Differences

- **Texas**: 2 universities (UT and A&M systems)
- **Oregon**: Multiple universities and community colleges
- **Texas**: Land-based primarily
- **Oregon**: Land + tax allocations

## Conclusion

The Oregon Higher Education Permanent Fund would create a constitutionally protected permanent fund dedicated to supporting public higher education. By establishing an endowment that grows over time, the fund would provide:

1. **Stable Funding**: Protected from budget cuts and economic downturns
2. **Growing Support**: Earnings increase as fund grows over decades
3. **Student Benefits**: Reduced tuition or increased financial aid
4. **Long-term Investment**: Investment in Oregon's human capital

The fund would supplement (not replace) General Fund appropriations, providing stable base funding while allowing flexibility. This hybrid approach combines the stability of a permanent fund with the flexibility of annual appropriations.

The proposal requires:

- **Constitutional Amendment**: Establish permanent fund and principal protection
- **Land Dedication or Tax Allocation**: Dedicate resources to fund
- **Initial Seed Funding**: $500M - $1B appropriation or bond issue
- **Oregon Higher Education Permanent Fund Corporation**: Independent management board
- **Voter Approval**: Ballot measure for constitutional amendment

This would create Oregon's first permanent fund dedicated to higher education, following the proven model of Texas Permanent University Fund but serving all of Oregon's public higher education institutions.
