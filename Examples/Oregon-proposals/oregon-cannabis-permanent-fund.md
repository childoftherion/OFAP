# Oregon Cannabis Permanent Fund (OCPF)

## Overview

The Oregon Cannabis Permanent Fund (OCPF) would establish a constitutionally protected permanent fund for Oregon using revenues from the existing commercial cannabis industry, similar to how Alaska created the Alaska Permanent Fund from oil revenues. This proposal dedicates a portion of existing OLCC cannabis tax revenues and fees to a permanent fund for future generations of Oregonians, while maintaining Oregon's private cannabis industry structure.

### ⭐ NO NEW TAXES - 100% from Existing Revenues

**Key Point**: The Oregon Cannabis Permanent Fund is funded **entirely from existing revenues** that are already being collected from Oregon's commercial cannabis industry. **No new taxes are required, no tax rates are increased, and no new fees are imposed.**

**Current Revenue Structure (Unchanged):**

- **17% Retail Tax**: Existing tax rate - NO INCREASE
- **Licensing Fees**: Existing fees - NO NEW FEES
- **Application Fees**: Existing fees - NO NEW FEES
- **All Revenues Already Collected**: OLCC currently collects $195-210 million annually

**Proposed Fund Allocation:**

- **10% of Existing Tax Revenue**: $16.95 million annually (from existing 17% tax)
- **All Existing Licensing Fees**: $20-30 million annually (existing fees)
- **Total to Fund**: $37-47 million annually
- **Source**: 100% from revenues already being collected

**Tax Impact: ZERO**

- 17% tax rate remains unchanged
- No new taxes created
- No tax increases required
- Fund grows from existing revenue streams

## Concept: Permanent Fund from Commercial Cannabis Revenue

### Alaska Model

- **Alaska Permanent Fund**: Established 1976 with constitutional requirement that at least 25% of oil revenues go to permanent fund
- **Revenue Source**: Oil companies pay royalties and taxes on natural resources
- **Permanent Fund Corporation**: Professional management ensures long-term growth
- **Results**: $64-80 billion fund, $1,600+ annual dividends per resident

### Oregon Cannabis Opportunity

- **Current System**: Private commercial cannabis industry; OLCC collects 17% tax and licensing fees
- **Proposed System**: Allocate percentage of existing OLCC cannabis revenues to permanent fund
- **Revenue Model**: Portion of cannabis tax revenue and fees dedicated to permanent fund
- **Industry Structure**: Private commercial cannabis industry continues operating unchanged
- **Potential**: Create multi-billion dollar permanent fund benefiting all Oregonians

## Proposed Structure

### Constitutional Amendment

**Article XV, Section 19 - Oregon Cannabis Permanent Fund**

1. **Establishment**: There is established the Oregon Cannabis Permanent Fund, a constitutionally protected permanent fund.

2. **Funding Requirement**: At least 25% of all cannabis tax revenues and licensing fees collected by the Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission (OLCC) from commercial cannabis operations shall be deposited into the permanent fund principal. The principal shall not be spent.

3. **Management**: The fund shall be managed by the Oregon Cannabis Permanent Fund Corporation, an independent board with professional investment management.

4. **Earnings Distribution**: Earnings from the fund shall be:

   - Distributed to all Oregon residents as annual dividends, or
   - Used for other purposes as determined by law, EXCEPT:
     - Earnings may NOT be used for public education funding
     - Earnings may NOT be used for public health programs
     - Earnings may NOT be transferred to the state general fund

   These protections ensure the fund's earnings benefit Oregonians directly and cannot be diverted to replace existing state funding obligations.

5. **Principal Protection**: The principal of the fund may not be spent except as authorized by constitutional amendment approved by voters.

6. **Earnings Protection**:

   a. Earnings from the fund may not be reallocated for public education, public health programs, or transferred to the state general fund.

   b. Any change to the earnings distribution method or allocation must be approved by a majority vote of Oregon voters through a constitutional amendment or ballot measure. The Legislature may not change earnings distribution without voter approval.

   These protections prevent the permanent fund from being used to replace existing state funding obligations, ensure earnings benefit Oregonians directly, and require public consent for any changes to how earnings are used.

7. **Private Industry Maintained**: This amendment does not authorize state ownership or operation of cannabis businesses. The private commercial cannabis industry shall continue operating under existing regulatory framework.

## OLCC Cannabis Revenue Sources

### Current Commercial Cannabis Revenue Structure

**Existing Revenue Streams (NO NEW TAXES):**

- **17% Retail Tax**: Collected on all recreational cannabis sales (existing tax, no increase)
- **Licensing Fees**: Annual license fees from cannabis businesses (existing fees)
- **Application Fees**: New business applications and renewals (existing fees)
- **Penalties and Fines**: Regulatory enforcement revenue (existing revenue)

**Important**: The Oregon Cannabis Permanent Fund is funded entirely from **existing cannabis tax revenues and fees**. No new taxes are required, and no tax increases are needed.

### Revenue Figures (2025-2027 Projections)

**Based on Official OLCC Data:**

- **Cannabis Tax Revenue (17% tax)**: $169.5 million annually
  - **2023-2025 Actual**: $148 million annually
  - **2025-2027 Projected**: $169.5 million annually
  - **Growth Rate**: 14.5% increase projected
- **Licensing Fees**: $20-30 million annually (estimated, supports OLCC operations)
- **Application Fees & Other**: $5-10 million annually (estimated)
- **Total OLCC Cannabis Revenue**: $195-210 million annually

**Source**: Oregon Department of Revenue - Cannabis Tax Statistics, OLCC Budget Documents

### Current Distribution (Statutory - Mandatory by Law)

Cannabis tax revenue is **statutorily mandated** to be distributed as follows (2025-2027 projections):

- **State School Fund**: 40% = **$67.8 million annually** ($135.6M biennium)
- **Mental Health/Addiction Services**: 20% = **$33.9 million annually** ($67.8M biennium)
- **State Police**: 15% = **$25.4 million annually** ($50.85M biennium)
- **Counties**: 10% = **$17.0 million annually** ($33.9M biennium)
- **Cities**: 10% = **$17.0 million annually** ($33.9M biennium)
- **OLCC Operations**: 5% = **$8.5 million annually** ($16.95M biennium)

**Note**: Distribution formula is statutory and cannot be changed without legislative or ballot measure approval.

### Proposed Permanent Fund Allocation (NO NEW TAXES)

**Key Principle: 100% from Existing Revenues**

The Oregon Cannabis Permanent Fund is funded entirely from **existing cannabis tax revenues and fees**. No new taxes are created, no tax rates are increased, and no new fees are imposed. The fund uses a reallocation of existing revenues that are already being collected from the commercial cannabis industry.

**Option 1: Percentage of Tax Revenue Only (Reallocation)**

- **25% of Tax Revenue**: $42.4 million annually (25% of $169.5M)
- **Source**: Reallocate from existing statutory distributions
- **Impact**: Reduces other allocations proportionally by 25%
  - Education: From 40% to 30% ($50.9M instead of $67.8M)
  - Mental Health: From 20% to 15% ($25.4M instead of $33.9M)
  - State Police: From 15% to 11.25% ($19.1M instead of $25.4M)
  - Counties: From 10% to 7.5% ($12.8M instead of $17.0M)
  - Cities: From 10% to 7.5% ($12.8M instead of $17.0M)
  - OLCC: From 5% to 3.75% ($6.4M instead of $8.5M)

**Option 2: All Licensing Fees (Preferred - Minimal Impact)**

- **All Licensing Fees**: $20-30 million annually
- **Source**: Existing licensing fees (currently support OLCC operations)
- **Impact**: Minimal - fees not statutorily dedicated to specific programs
- **Advantage**: No reduction to existing tax revenue distributions
- **Note**: OLCC operations would need alternative funding source

**Option 3: Hybrid Model (Recommended) ⭐**

**Allocation Formula (NO NEW TAXES):**

- **10% of Tax Revenue**: $16.95 million annually (10% of $169.5M)
  - **Source**: Reallocate small percentage from existing distributions
  - **Impact**: Minimal reduction (each program reduced by 10%)
- **All Licensing Fees**: $20-30 million annually
  - **Source**: Existing fees, reallocated from OLCC operations
  - **Impact**: OLCC operations funded from alternative source
- **Total Annual Deposits**: **$37-47 million annually**
- **No New Taxes**: 100% from existing revenues already being collected
- **Growth Potential**: Fund could reach $1.5-2.5 billion in 25-30 years

**Why This Approach Works:**

1. **No New Taxes**: Uses only existing 17% tax rate (no increase needed)
2. **Minimal Impact**: Only 10% reallocation reduces impact on existing programs
3. **Fees Redirection**: Licensing fees redirected to permanent fund
4. **Existing Revenue**: All funds already being collected by OLCC
5. **Transparency**: Clear that no tax increases are required

## Governance Structure

### Oregon Cannabis Permanent Fund Corporation (OCPFC)

**Modeled After Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation:**

- **Board of Trustees**: 7-9 members appointed by Governor and confirmed by Senate
- **Independence**: Independent board, not subject to legislative or executive control

### Option 2: Direct Payment Programs

- **Use**: Specific direct benefit programs for Oregonians
- **Examples**:
  - Property tax rebates
  - Utility assistance for low-income households
  - Infrastructure improvements in rural communities
- **Protection**: Direct benefits to residents, not state programs

### Option 3: Other Protected Uses

Earnings may be used for other purposes that directly benefit Oregonians, such as:

- **Rural Economic Development**: Direct grants to rural communities
- **Environmental Programs**: Conservation and environmental protection
- **Infrastructure**: Public infrastructure projects
- **Emergency Assistance**: Natural disaster relief funds

**Note**: All distribution options are subject to constitutional protections preventing use for public education, public health programs, or state general fund transfers.

### Protected From Reallocation

**Constitutional Protections:**

**Earnings May NOT Be Used For (Permanently Prohibited):**

- ❌ **Public Education Funding**: Prevents fund from replacing state education obligations
- ❌ **Public Health Programs**: Prevents fund from replacing state health obligations
- ❌ **State General Fund Transfers**: Prevents fund from being used for general state operations

**Public Vote Required for Any Changes:**

## Constitutional Protection

### Why Constitutional Amendment

**Precedent:**

- **Alaska Permanent Fund**: Constitutional protection prevented legislative raids
- **Oregon Common School Fund**: Constitutional protection for 165+ years
- **Texas Funds**: Constitutional protection for 170+ years

**Benefits:**

- **Permanence**: Fund cannot be eliminated by Legislature
- **Principal Protection**: Principal cannot be spent without voter approval
- **Earnings Protection**: Earnings protected from reallocation to education, health, or general fund
- **Public Vote Requirement**: Any change to earnings distribution requires voter approval
- **Public Trust**: Constitutional status builds public confidence
- **Long-term Commitment**: Demonstrates commitment to future generations

### Earnings Protection Provisions

**Constitutional Protections:**

1. **Prohibited Uses**: Earnings cannot be diverted to replace state education funding

   - Earnings may NOT be used for public education funding
   - Earnings may NOT be used for public health programs
   - Earnings may NOT be transferred to the state general fund
   - Protects fund from being used to backfill state budgets
   - Ensures earnings benefit residents directly, not state programs

2. **Public Vote Requirement**: Any change to earnings distribution requires voter approval

   - Legislature cannot change how earnings are distributed without voter approval
   - Changes must be approved through constitutional amendment or ballot measure
   - Ensures public consent for any reallocation of earnings
   - Prevents legislative attempts to divert earnings without public knowledge

3. **Double Protection**: Both specific prohibitions and voter approval requirement
   - Specific uses are permanently prohibited (education, health, general fund)
   - Any other changes to distribution require public vote
   - Multiple layers of protection ensure fund cannot be raided

**How Public Vote Requirement Works:**

- **Initial Distribution**: When fund is established, initial distribution method determined by enabling legislation (subject to constitutional prohibitions)
- **Changing Distribution**: To change how earnings are distributed, Legislature must refer constitutional amendment or ballot measure to voters
- **Voter Approval Required**: Any change requires majority vote of Oregon voters
- **No Legislative Override**: Legislature cannot override public vote requirement
- **Transparency**: All proposed changes must be publicly debated and voted on

**Examples of Changes Requiring Public Vote:**

- Changing from universal dividends to specific program funding
- Adding new permitted uses for earnings
- Changing distribution formulas or percentages
- Modifying who receives earnings (e.g., changing eligibility criteria)
- Any other change to how earnings are allocated or distributed

**Rationale for Protections:**

- **Prevent Fund Raids**: Stops Legislature from using fund to replace existing obligations
- **Public Control**: Requires voter approval for any changes, ensuring public oversight
- **Direct Benefits**: Ensures earnings go directly to Oregonians, not state programs
- **Long-term Growth**: Protections ensure fund grows for future generations
- **Public Trust**: Strong protections and voter approval requirement build confidence in fund's permanence
- **Transparency**: Public vote requirement ensures all changes are publicly debated

## Political Feasibility

### Supporters

- **Progressives**: Universal benefits, permanent fund model, direct public investment
- **Fiscal Conservatives**: Long-term fiscal responsibility, principal and earnings protection
- **Anti-Raid Advocates**: Strong protections prevent fund from being used to replace existing obligations
- **Rural Communities**: Potential dividends benefit rural areas directly
- **Cannabis Industry**: Industry continues operating, permanent fund provides long-term stability

- **Direct Benefit Advocates**: Earnings go directly to Oregonians, not state programs

### Opposition

- **Existing Program Recipients**: May oppose reducing current distributions
- **Some Budget Advocates**: May prefer immediate use of all revenues
- **Short-term Thinkers**: May prefer current distribution over long-term fund
- **Education/Health Advocates**: May want fund earnings available for their programs (opposed by protections)

**Note**: The constitutional protections prevent fund earnings from being used for education and health programs, which may generate opposition from those sectors. However, these protections are essential to prevent the fund from being raided to replace existing state obligations.

### Strategy

- **Emphasize Direct Public Benefit**: Focus on direct dividends or payments to Oregonians
- **Alaska Model Success**: Reference successful Alaska Permanent Fund with universal dividends
- **Small Allocation**: Emphasize small percentage (15-25%) minimizes impact on existing programs
- **Private Industry Maintained**: No threat to existing cannabis businesses
- **Long-term Vision**: Investment for future generations
- **Strong Protections**: Emphasize protections prevent fund from being raided for state programs
- **Direct Distribution**: Frame as direct benefit to residents, not state program funding

## Potential Modifications

### Alternative Allocation Percentages (NO NEW TAXES)

**All options use 100% existing revenues - no new taxes required:**

**Conservative Approach - Fees Only:**

- **Allocation**: All licensing fees (~$20-30M annually)
- **Source**: Existing fees only, no tax revenue reallocation
- **Impact**: Zero impact on existing tax revenue distributions
- **Advantage**: Preserves all existing program funding
- **Growth**: Reaches $800M - $1.2 billion in 25-30 years
- **Tax Impact**: NO CHANGE to 17% tax rate

**Recommended Approach - Hybrid (10% + Fees):**

- **Allocation**: 10% of tax revenue + all fees = $37-47M annually
- **Source**: Existing revenues (10% reallocation + existing fees)
- **Impact**: Minimal reduction (10%) to existing distributions
- **Growth**: Reaches $1.5-2.5 billion in 25-30 years
- **Tax Impact**: NO CHANGE to 17% tax rate

**Moderate Approach (15% + Fees):**

- **Allocation**: 15% of tax revenue + all fees = $45-56M annually
- **Source**: Existing revenues (15% reallocation + existing fees)
- **Impact**: Moderate reduction (15%) to existing distributions
- **Growth**: Reaches $2.0-3.0 billion in 25-30 years
- **Tax Impact**: NO CHANGE to 17% tax rate

**Aggressive Approach (25% + Fees):**

- **Allocation**: 25% of tax revenue + all fees = $62-73M annually
- **Source**: Existing revenues (25% reallocation + existing fees)
- **Impact**: Larger reduction (25%) to existing distributions
- **Growth**: Reaches $3.0-4.5 billion in 25-30 years
- **Tax Impact**: NO CHANGE to 17% tax rate

**Key Point**: All approaches use **existing 17% tax rate** - no tax increases required. Fund grows from revenues already being collected.

## Conclusion

The Oregon Cannabis Permanent Fund proposal would create a constitutionally protected permanent fund from **existing commercial cannabis revenues** (NO NEW TAXES), similar to how Alaska created the Alaska Permanent Fund from oil revenues. By dedicating a portion of existing OLCC cannabis tax revenues and fees to a permanent fund, Oregon could:

1. **Create Multi-Billion Dollar Fund**: Build $1.5-4.0 billion fund over 25-30 years
2. **Benefit All Oregonians**: Universal dividends or direct payment programs
3. **Long-term Stability**: Permanent revenue source for future generations
4. **Follow Proven Model**: Alaska Permanent Fund demonstrates success
5. **Maintain Private Industry**: Commercial cannabis industry continues operating unchanged
6. **Strong Protections**: Earnings protected from reallocation to education, health, or general fund
7. **NO NEW TAXES**: Funded 100% from existing revenues already being collected

**Funding Source (NO NEW TAXES):**

- **Existing 17% Tax Rate**: No tax increase required
- **Existing Licensing Fees**: Redirection of fees already being collected
- **Recommended Allocation**: 10% of tax revenue ($16.95M) + all fees ($20-30M) = $37-47M annually
- **100% from Existing Revenue**: No new taxes, no tax increases, no new fees

The proposal requires:

- **Constitutional Amendment**: Establish permanent fund with principal and earnings protection
- **Enabling Legislation**: Allocate percentage of existing OLCC cannabis revenues to fund
- **Oregon Cannabis Permanent Fund Corporation**: Independent management board
- **Voter Approval**: Ballot measure for constitutional amendment

**Key Protections:**

- **Principal Protection**: Principal cannot be spent without voter approval
- **Earnings Protection**: Earnings cannot be used for public education, public health programs, or transferred to state general fund
- **Public Vote Requirement**: Any change to earnings distribution requires voter approval through constitutional amendment or ballot measure
- **Direct Benefits**: Earnings must benefit Oregonians directly, not replace existing state obligations
- **No Legislative Reallocation**: Legislature cannot change earnings distribution without public vote
- **NO NEW TAXES**: Fund uses only existing revenues - no tax increases required

This proposal applies the Alaska Permanent Fund model to cannabis revenues while maintaining Oregon's existing commercial cannabis industry structure and **existing 17% tax rate**. The fund is funded entirely from existing revenues already being collected, requiring no new taxes or tax increases. The strong constitutional protections ensure the fund cannot be raided to replace existing state funding obligations, guaranteeing that earnings benefit Oregonians directly for generations to come.
