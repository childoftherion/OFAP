# Oregon Food Assistance Program (OFAP) - Ballot Measures & Budget Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains ballot measure proposals and state budget analysis for establishing a **state-funded EBT-style food assistance program** in Oregon. The project addresses the critical food security crisis affecting hundreds of thousands of Oregonians who have lost federal SNAP benefits due to government shutdown.

## The Crisis

Oregon is currently experiencing a severe food security crisis:

- **757,000 Oregonians** depend on SNAP benefits that have been disrupted due to federal government shutdown
- Governor Tina Kotek has declared a **60-day food security emergency**
- State allocated only $5 million to food banks as emergency response
- **Critical Need**: Establish a state-funded program independent of federal funding to protect Oregon families from future disruptions

## Project Purpose

This project provides:

1. **Complete ballot measure proposals** for creating a state-funded Oregon Food Assistance Program (OFAP)
2. **Comprehensive budget analysis** of Oregon's revenue sources and funding capacity
3. **Strategic recommendations** for program implementation and funding
4. **Public support strategies** designed to achieve broad, bipartisan voter approval

## Key Components

### Ballot Measures (`considerations/`)

Four ballot measures designed to establish the Oregon Food Assistance Program and create permanent funds for Oregon:

#### Measure 1: Oregon Food Security Amendment (Constitutional)

- Establishes food security as a fundamental right in the Oregon Constitution
- Similar to Measure 111 (2022) which established healthcare as a right
- Creates permanent legal framework requiring state to maintain food assistance program
- Provides stability beyond individual legislative sessions

#### Measure 2: Oregon Food Assistance Program Act (Statutory)

- Creates the actual EBT-style program with detailed implementation framework
- Eligibility: Households at 185% of federal poverty level
- Monthly EBT benefits based on household size and income
- Administered by Oregon Department of Human Services
- All Oregon residents eligible (no immigration status restrictions)

#### Measure 3: Oregon Food Security Fund (Statutory)

- Establishes dedicated funding source with independent oversight board
- Primary funding from existing General Fund (no new taxes required)
- Administrative cost cap: 5%
- Multiple revenue sources for flexibility
- Ensures transparency and fiscal responsibility

#### Measure 4: Oregon Cannabis Permanent Fund (Constitutional)

- Creates constitutionally protected permanent fund from existing cannabis revenues
- **NO NEW TAXES**: Uses only existing 17% tax rate and existing licensing fees
- 10% of existing tax revenue + all licensing fees to permanent fund ($37-47M annually)
- Principal protection: Principal cannot be spent without voter approval
- Earnings protection: Earnings cannot be reallocated by the legislative body without voter approval
- Public vote required for any earnings reallocation changes
- Universal dividends or direct payment programs
- Private cannabis industry continues operating unchanged
- Modeled after Alaska Permanent Fund (48+ years, $64-80 billion)

### Budget Analysis (`State-budget/`)

Comprehensive analysis of Oregon's state budget and revenue sources based on official [NASBO budget data](State-budget/nasbo-budget-data.md):

- **2025-2027 Biennium Budget**: $138.9 billion total ([Source: NASBO](https://www.nasbo.org/mainsite/resources/proposed-enacted-budgets/oregon-budget))
- **General Fund**: $37.3 billion (biennium) ([Source: NASBO](https://www.nasbo.org/mainsite/resources/proposed-enacted-budgets/oregon-budget))
- **Lottery Fund**: $1.8 billion (biennium) ([Source: NASBO](https://www.nasbo.org/mainsite/resources/proposed-enacted-budgets/oregon-budget))
- **OLCC Revenue**: ~$522 million annually (liquor + cannabis)
- **Reserves**: $3.42 billion (Education Stability + Rainy Day Funds) ([Source: NASBO](https://www.nasbo.org/mainsite/resources/proposed-enacted-budgets/oregon-budget))

**Key Finding**: OFAP ($650-850M annually) represents only 3.5-4.6% of biennial General Fund - **fully manageable** within Oregon's budget structure.

### Strategic Documents

- **Public Support Strategy**: Coalition-building approach for broad bipartisan support
- **Implementation Roadmap**: Phased rollout plan (pilot ‚Üí full statewide)
- **Key Talking Points**: Campaign messaging for different constituencies

## Key Findings

### Funding Capacity

- **Primary Recommendation**: General Fund appropriation ($650-750M annually)

  - Represents only 3.5-4.0% of biennial General Fund
  - No new taxes required
  - Most politically feasible approach

- **Optional Supplements** (if approved):
  - Lottery Fund: 3-5% allocation (~$7-13M annually)
  - OLCC Cannabis: 5-7% allocation (~$8-12M annually)

### Program Costs

- **Annual Cost**: $650-850 million
  - Benefits: $600-800 million
  - Administration: $30-40 million (5% cap)
  - Systems: $10-15 million

### Economic Benefits

- **Economic Activity**: Every $1 generates $1.50-$2.00 in economic activity
- **Total Economic Impact**: $960 million - $1.7 billion annually
- **Healthcare Savings**: $100-200 million annually (prevented malnutrition costs)
- **Tax Revenue Generated**: $50-100 million annually (from economic activity)
- **Net Benefit**: Positive return on investment

### Design Principles

1. **Learn from History**

   - ‚úÖ Measure 111 (2022): Healthcare as fundamental right - SUCCESS
   - ‚ùå Measure 118 (2022): Corporate tax increases - FAILURE
   - **Strategy**: Frame as fundamental right, avoid punitive taxation

2. **Build Broad Support**

   - Progressives: Human rights, social justice
   - Conservatives: State sovereignty, fiscal responsibility
   - Business: Economic growth, consumer spending
   - Rural: Agricultural support, local economy

3. **Fiscal Responsibility**
   - No new taxes required (primary funding from existing General Fund)
   - Administrative cost cap: 5%
   - Independent oversight board
   - Efficiency and transparency built in
